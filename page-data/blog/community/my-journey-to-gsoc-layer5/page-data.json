I learned so many new things and got to work with so many amazing people. I enjoyed contributing so much that  I even forgot to apply to many programs, which was my sole reason to start contributing.

As soon as you drop-in Layer5\\u2019s slack, you get welcomed by many other fellow contributors. There are always people around to help you if you get stuck anywhere. I recently visited my first issue in Layer5 to find out the issue being so simple and so many great memories flew through me. I still remember the feeling when my first pr was merged I was in seventh heaven, I still love that purple and want a daily dose of that.
