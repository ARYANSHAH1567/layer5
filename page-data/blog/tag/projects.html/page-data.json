Even if the project is small or too big, the creator or the team behind the project needs to curate the documentation very well such that it'll be useful for new end users to refer and learn to use the project, troubleshoot the problems occurred and lot more. Thus, we, Layer5 have curated the documentation for Meshery to meet such purposes. Not to mention, <code>mesheryctl</code>, the CLI client of Meshery needs a curated documentation as well. This blog describes about the evolution of <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page. </p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Initial Command Reference Design</h3>\n<p>\nThe initial design of <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page is all made using pure markdown and the functionality is handled using Jekyll, the main framework used for Meshery Docs. This handled great at initial stage but had many limitations, such as:\n    <ul>\n        <li>Updation of YAML for data is often required</li>\n        <li>Design was obselete at initial stage</li>\n        <li>No separate pages for each command and subcommand</li>\n    </ul>\n    Thus, the idea for redesigning the <code>mesheryctl</code> reference page was desperately needed.\n    </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\" alt=\"Meshery Documentation\" target=\"_parent\">\n    <img src = {oldDesign} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Initial design of mesheryctl command reference\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>Updated Command Reference Design</h3>\n<p>To tackle the shortcomings of the previous design, I was tasked to redesign the <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page entirely. This was a big task at first glance to me, as I was a new contributor back then. Eventually after manipulating the reference section with help of great folks, I was able to pull off the task and the design was updated. </p> \n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\" alt=\"Meshery Documentation\">\n<img src={newDesign} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Meshery CLI command reference\" /></a>\n</p>\n<p>The redesign work was done with help of HTML in markdown and with optimization in YAML code. A sample is given below.</p>\n\n```\n    <!-- Copy this template to create individual doc pages for each mesheryctl commands -->\n\n    <!-- Name of the command -->\n    # mesheryctl mesh\n\n    <!-- Description of the command. Preferably a paragraph -->\n    ## Description\n\n    {% assign name = site.data.mesheryctlcommands.cmds[page.command] %}\n    {{ name.description }}\n\n    <!-- Basic usage of the command -->\n    <pre className=\"codeblock-pre\">\n    <div className=\"codeblock\">\n    mesheryctl mesh [flags] \n    </div>\n    </pre>\n    ...........\n```\n\n<h3>Adding auto generation feature in reference</h3>\n<p>As time passed, we realized that the command reference missed something for a while, though the design has been changed. Then, we thought the idea of automating the generation of docs such that developers don't need to change the code in docs section while working towards <code>mesheryctl</code>. That's where we got to know that Cobra library (the library for CLI apps made using golang) has a feature to make doc pages automatically. So we decided to incorporate that feature into <code>mesheryctl</code> docs page as well! After making several changes and a PR, I was finally able to introduce the feature in the docs site!</p>\n\n```\nvar startCmd = &cobra.Command {\n\tUse:   \"start\",\n\tShort: \"Start Meshery\",\n\tLong:  `Start Meshery and each of its service mesh components.`,\n\tArgs:  cobra.NoArgs,\n\tExample: `\n// Start meshery\nmesheryctl system start\n// To create a new context for in-cluster Kubernetes deployments and set the new context as your current-context\nmesheryctl system context create k8s -p kubernetes -s\n// (optional) skip checking for new updates available in Meshery.\nmesheryctl system start --skip-update\n// Reset Meshery's configuration file to default settings.\nmesheryctl system start --reset\n// Silently create Meshery's configuration file with default settings\nmesheryctl system start --yes\n.....\n}\n\t`,\n```\n\n<p>Using this information provided above in each golang file, the markdown page is generated using Cobra CLI library and thus reducing the workload on the developer by automating via <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/.github/workflows/mesheryctl-ci.yml#L73\">GitHub Actions</a>.</p>\n<br />\n<p>This is so far on how the <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference is evolved for now. And I hope that it'll continue to evolve in the field of documentation to serve the users to use Meshery in best way possible.</p>\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Evolution of the Meshery CLI Command Reference","subtitle":null,"date":"June 9th, 2022","author":"Aadhitya Amarendiran","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABwBACdASoUAA0APtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJbACdMoGvtgJwx880HleA8ofTgAD+2VgctvGN2cFdfAJj4YJ0Ha8AiiMSiWh82G/yk9ZshKIR54QST0HBPk98AjqzxGHfuVZiMjvT9XDm39S3tEJ+oAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/f06bf/mesheryctl.webp 750w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/8c7d4/mesheryctl.webp 1080w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6316666666666667}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/mesheryctl.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABwBACdASoUAA0APtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJbACdMoGvtgJwx880HleA8ofTgAD+2VgctvGN2cFdfAJj4YJ0Ha8AiiMSiWh82G/yk9ZshKIR54QST0HBPk98AjqzxGHfuVZiMjvT9XDm39S3tEJ+oAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/704ce/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/5a879/mesheryctl.webp 125w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/6d26b/mesheryctl.webp 250w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/704ce/mesheryctl.webp 500w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/5c637/mesheryctl.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":316}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/mesheryctl.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/evolution-of-the-meshery-cli-command-reference"}},{"id":"5d6e85c1-a958-51c5-a20e-1308e5fd0237","body":"\n\n\n\nimport UnitTest from \"./unit-test.webp\";\nimport IntegrationTest from \"./integration-test.webp\";\nimport TreeGraph from \"./tree-graph.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"intro \">\n<p>Delivering a high quality user experience is our pinnacle goal in the design of Meshery's CLI: <code>mesheryctl</code>. Delivering a high quality user experience means testing both qualitatively and quantatively. As a concept, quality - whether you're talking about software or anything else - can be directly measured by consistency. A quality user experience is consistent and consistency of <code>mesheryctl</code> is reinforced by its many unit tests.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><code>mesheryctl</code> is written in Golang. In the Meshery project, we use CodeCov to calculate the code coverage across <code>mesheryctl</code>'s line of code. And there are plenty of lines of code. Achieving high percentages of code coverage in Meshery's CLI with grows in criticality as we bring more features into <code>mesheryctl</code> as a robust and sophisticated command line client of Meshery. Unit and integration tests bolster and roll up into broader end-to-end, functional testing performed across Meshery and the rest of its components. </p>\n\n<p>High levels of code coverage makes it easier for each project contributor to be confident that their code changes aren’t breaking any preexisting <code>mesheryctl</code> commands, side-swiping their functionality unknowingly, and consequently, unwittingly lowering the quality of Meshery's overall user experience.</p>\n\n<h3> mesheryctl lines of code</h3>\n\n\n```yaml\n\n    270 text files.\n    106 unique files.\n    166 files ignored.\n\n    cloc v 1.92  T=0.15 s (692.3 files/s, 110063.3 lines/s)\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Language       files          blank        comment           code\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Go                88           2128           1330          13045\n    YAML              12              0              0            215\n    JSON               4              0              0             42\n    make               1             10              2             31\n    Markdown           1             23              0             27\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    SUM:             106           2161           1332          13360\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n<p>Unit Tests can be written in two ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand\n        <ol>\n            <li>Mock Meshery(backend) response if needed</li>\n            <li>Grab console output</li>\n            <li>Store standard/verified mesheryctl output in a golden file(a text file)</li>\n            <li>Match the stored/expected output with what we grab from the console</li>\n            <li>Cover as many scenarios as possible, test the situations where errors must be thrown</li>\n            <li>This is a standard format, changes can be made accordingly</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> functions\n        <ol>\n            <li>This is the standard testing you may have come across in every project</li>\n            <li>You write one test dedicated to one function covering all possible test-cases, matching expected outputs</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Example tree graph</h3>\n<p>This example of a tree graph (from <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/4823\">meshery/meshery/pull/4823</a>) shows the impact given changes make on the level of code coverage.</p>\n\n<img src={TreeGraph} />\n\n<h3>Integration Tests</h3>\n\n<p>Integrations tests come into view when you cannot mock something easily and when a given behavior is cross-functional / cross-component. Integration tests put more, but not all of the focus validating system behavior and that the system completes all the necessary actions. Take <code>mesheryctl system start</code> for example. This command deploys Meshery, its adapters, and Kubernetes Operator; it starts Meshery. So, you run the command to start Meshery in a GitHub workflow and after running the <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand through the tests and make sure that Meshery actually started. And if the workflow successfully runs the test, then boom!, you aced your integration writing test... errr... test writing.</p>\n\n<p>The integration test writing exam can initially be challenging, but... that’s the fun in it. :) Running tests and making sure a command that is otherwise hard to verify, hard to test, and making it automatic through GH workflows.</p>\n\n<h3>How you can make an impact</h3>\n\n<p>Writing tests and making them work is in itself a tough task to do, so writing one test for a single function counts and makes a big difference over the long term. Don't hesitate. Start writing tests now. A single, new test is worthy of raising a pull request and will get you well on your way to learning much more about Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, and service meshes.</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://codecov.io/gh/meshery/meshery/\">Codecov</a> is used to check code coverage in <code>mesheryctl</code> (login with GitHub to get an in-depth idea of lines-of-code being covered in code coverage).</li>\n    <li>You can check the files on CodeCov’s website to figure out which mesheryctl commands haven’t been covered by existing tests.</li>\n    <li>Guide: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRlFpElRmybJ3WacgPKXgCSiQ2poJl3iCCV1dAalf0k/edit#heading=h.rzpmb66db1sq\">Writing tests for mesheryctl</a>.

Your tests will be executed and used time-and-time again. I can’t explain in words (I don’t have that good of a vocabulary). Your Tests are going to run in each pull request raised against the Meshery project, in each commit someone pushes to a pull request, in every nightly regression test suite, in every release. Just think: if another contributor incidently introduces a defect or doesn't consider for an edge case, and fails to uphold the intended behavior of the code, your tests are going to catch them redhanded. How cool is that?</p>\n\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? Jump in and write a few tests today! When you raise your pull request, label it with <code>area/tests</code> and <code>component/mesheryctl</code> and I'll be there to review!

Essentially, a management plane helps\n  you integrate service meshes into your backend systems. A robust management\n  plane allows you to take full advantage of the power of the network while\n  integrating your service delivery processes seamlessly. Your management plane\n  might federate different types of service meshes, help you instigate chaos\n  through controlled experiments, or offer automated traffic splitting in order\n  to execute different styles of canarying of your applications. Your management\n  plane might offer deep insights into the performance of your applications and\n  to the performance of your infrastructure or might deliver a change in\n  management framework.\n</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <img\n    src={MesheryLogo}\n    align=\"center\"\n    alt=\"meshery-logo\"\n    height=\"35rem\"\n    width=\"35rem\"\n    style={{paddingBottom: \"5px\", paddingTop: \"auto\"}}\n  />{\" \"}\n  Meshery\n</h3>\n\n<img\n  src={MeshManager}\n  className=\"slides-left\"\n  align=\"right\"\n  alt=\"mesh-manager\"\n/>\n<p>\n  <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> manages the\n  lifecycle of service meshes.

In this talk, he walked through service mesh specifications and why they matter in your deployment.\n   How many service mesh specifications do you know? He went through all of them. So, no worries if you're unfamiliar.\n  </p>\n</div>   \n\n### Service Mesh Specifications:\n<img src={Abstractions} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"abstractions\" />\n\nAs the ubiquity of service meshes unfolds and they become a commonplace for any cloud native or edge environment, so does the need for vendor and technology-agnostic interfaces to interact with them. The Service Mesh Interface (SMI), the Service Mesh Performance (SMP), and Multi-Vendor Service Mesh Interoperation (Hamlet) are three open specifications solving the challenge of interoperability, workload and performance management between service meshes. \n\nLearn what makes each of them unique and why they are much needed. See each of these three specifications in action as we use Meshery, the open-source service mesh management plane to demonstrate the value and functionality of each service mesh abstraction, and the adherence of these specifications by Istio, Linkerd, Consul and other popular service meshes.\n\n### Cloud native Journey to service meshes:\n\n<img src={Journey} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"journey-image\" />\n\nThe advent of cloud native was the popularization of containers. Thank you Docker! From there, containers took off like wildfire. Turns out you need an orchestrator to wrangle that sprawl. We saw a number of orchestrators come and we still have a number of orchestrators around.\n\nService meshes have become a hot topic in the last few years. They still continue to be, rightfully so, a very powerful piece of technology. “A lot of the power is yet to come from my perspective. For my part, I believe that there is a tomorrow in which data plane intelligence really matters. And matters about how people write cloud native applications.”, Lee emphasized. Not everyone quite understands the capabilities of meshes as they are promoted and spoken about today. So come along into the journey of service mesh.\n\nThere are a number of service meshes out there. One of the community projects is to track the landscape of all of the meshes there are. There’s a lot to say about each of them, their architecture, and their working. Why are they made? Who are they focused on? What do they do? When did they come about? Why are some of them not here anymore? Why are we still seeing new ones? A lot of things to go through. You might be interested in any number of the details that the landscape tracks.\n <div className=\"note\">Be Aware, It's Meshy Out There!</div>\n\n### Service Mesh Interface\n<img src={SMI} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"smi-image\" />\n<ul>\n    <li>Its goal and genesis were born inside of Kubernetes.</li>\n    <li> Being a specification that is native to Kubernetes, its focus is on lowest common denominator functionality.</li>\n    <li> The focus on bringing forth APIs that highlight and reinforce the most common use cases that service meshes are being used for currently</li>\n    <li>Leaves space and provides extensibility room for additional APIs to address other service mesh functionality as more people adopt and make use cases well known.</li>\n    <li>There are seven service meshes that claim compatibility with SMI. There's been a community effort, open-source effort to create service mesh conformance tests to assert whether or not a given service mesh is compatible with SMI</li>\n    <li> In order to facilitate those types of tests, you need to have a tool to provision a sample application on those services which will generate load and test whether traffic splitting behaves as expected or works with that service mesh implementation properly.</li>\n    <li>Then you need to be able to collect the results, guarantee the provenance of those results and publish them.</li>\n    <li> As a community, we turned to Meshery as the tool to implement <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI conformance</Link> and we have been working with the individual service meshes to validate their conformance. </li>\n</ul>    \n<b>Meshery</b>\n<ul>\n  <li> We work on an open-source project called <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>.</li>\n  <li> Meshery, the cloud native management plane, is the canonical implementation of the service mesh performance.</li>\n  <li>The management planes can do a number of things to help bridge the divide between other back-end systems and service meshes. They also help performance management, configuration management, making sure you are following best practices in your implementations by taking common patterns and applying them to your environment </li>\n</ul>\nLet's take a moment to demo what it looks like to validate conformance in SMI using Meshery.\n\n<img src={Graph} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"graph\" />\n<ul>\n   <li> We need to spin up Meshery locally</li>\n   <li> We use mesheryctl as the command line interface to work with Meshery.</li>\n   <li> We can interact with a number of different service mesh. The service mesh we’re going to work with today is an Open service mesh (one of those 7 that is compatible with SMI). Let’s put it to the test.</li>\n   <li> We'll initiate <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI conformance</Link></li>\n   <li>These tests go and do assertions across these different specifications. We’re looking at traffic access, traffic splitting, traffic specification. Meshery then collects these results and will eventually be publishing them in combination with the SMI project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n### Service Mesh Performance\n<img src={SMP} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"smp-image\" />\n<ul>\n    <li>Focused on describing and capturing the performance of a service mesh.</li>\n    <li>The overhead of the value is another way of looking at it and characterizing it.</li>\n    <li>Trying to characterize the performance of the infrastructure of a service mesh can be really difficult.</li>\n    <li>Considering the number of variables that you would have to track, how difficult it can be to have repeatable tests, and benchmark your environment, to track your history based on your environment, compare performance between other meshes people need.</li>\n    <li>SMP creates a standard way of capturing the performance of the mesh to help with these issues.</li>\n    <li>It's also the way in which you're configuring your control plan of your service mesh.</li>\n</ul>    \n\nYou might be using a client library to do some service mesh functionality. Maybe you're using those in combination with the service mesh. What costs more? What's more efficient? What's more powerful? Maybe you're using web assembly and filters there.\nThese are all open questions that <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">SMP</Link> assists in answering in your environment. You’d be surprised by some of the results of some tests that we have done and that the community has done in combination with a couple of universities and graduate students.\n\n<b>Performance Test</b>\n\nDemonstration of the implementation of service mesh Performance:\n\n<img src={Flowchart} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"flowchart\" />\n<ul>\n  <li> On the terminal, we have a local deployment of Meshery running. You can also deploy on Kubernetes as well as the vendor Kubernetes platforms like AKS, EKS and GCP or you can use a dockerized container to run Meshery. You can also have your Kubernetes on Docker desktop.</li>\n  <li>We have the Open service mesh deployed.</li>\n  <li> The Meshery UI is exposed at 9081 port. This is the UI which is used to instantiate a Load test.</li>\n  <li> Over here you can see we have 3 load generators fortio, wrk2, nighthawk.</li>\n  <li> All of these load generators have their own set of attributes which they record correctly and each of its attributes have their own significance. We begin with fortio.</li>\n  <img src={Bucket} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"graph\" />\n\n  <li> You can actually download the test results or you can just browse into the Results Tab and see all of the tests which you have run until now.</li>\n  <li>Next, we used nighthawk to generate the load and benchmark the service for the same. Nighthawk is a load generator which is maintained by the Envoy community and is relatively new. It still hasn't got its 1.0 release but right now Nighthawk has sufficient features to compete with different generators which are still in the play. It can generate a gRPC service on its own and it has some more attributes which you can expose using their CLI tools.</li>\n  <li> You can also see that Meshery has the capability to search your environment, see what specifications are being used and what's the load on your Kubernetes.</li>\n  <li>Jump into the results Tab and see how we compare with these results.</li>\n  <li>You can click on the download. You will see that a yaml gets downloaded in which you can browse and see that the start time, load time, the performance latencies, the metrics are being captured.</li>\n</ul>  \n\n### Hamlet or Multi-vendor Service Mesh Interoperation\n<img src={Hamlet} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"hamlet-image\" />\n<ul>\n  <li>Focus on service mesh federation</li>\n  <li>Specifies a set of API standards for enabling service mesh federation</li>\n  <li>Hamlet takes on a client-server architecture in which resources and services of one service mesh are discovered, registered and using a common format, information about them is exchanged between different service mesh.</li>\n  <li>Rules around authentication and authorization rules around which Services get exposed and to whom and who can communicate with them and whether or not they can do it securely. These are things that Hamlet addresses.</li>\n  <li>\n  The specification currently consists of two APIs:\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>The Federated Resource Discovery API</strong>: API to authenticate and securely distribute resources between federated service meshes.</li>\n      <li>The <strong>Federated Service Discovery API</strong>: API to discover, reach, authenticate and securely communicate with federated services.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Part of the real power is the ability to overcome what are likely to be separate administrative domains. The intention here is to marry up connect two disparate service mesh deployments, those deployments might be of the same type, they might be of two different types.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIn addition to SMI, SMP and Hamlet there has been an emergence of service mesh patterns, by which people are running and operating service meshes. There is a service mesh working group under CNCFs network that is helping identify those patterns of which there's a list right now unbeknownst to you. Reach out, join it, help us work through the 60 patterns that are defined right now. 30 of those are going into an <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books\">O’Reilly</Link> book called <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books/service-mesh-patterns\">Service Mesh Patterns</Link>.\n\nSomething that isn’t always obvious to folks is this piece of value that people get from a service mesh and actually from the specifications that we were just mentioning. It is the fact that teams are decoupled when you’re running a mesh. Developers get to iterate a bit independently of operators, and so do operators get to make changes to implement infrastructure to the way that applications behave independent of developers in the presence of a mesh.  Both of these teams are significantly empowered. Everybody gets a piece of power when they deploy a mesh.\n\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite  come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Service Mesh Specifications and Why They Matter","subtitle":null,"date":"September 20th, 2021","author":"Debopriya Bhattacharjee","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoR3N4AAWScxK3A0AAD+y+7TltDm8faWnWkrgNwKEaB+a5F7h6kfv+PNmIbiHtDLJbrKy70mpaSz/NUvAS+UKSii+WgoY4/+Ld6wAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/a66aa/Cover-image.webp 750w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/65dd5/Cover-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/f9724/Cover-image.webp 1366w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5630208333333334}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/Cover-image.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoR3N4AAWScxK3A0AAD+y+7TltDm8faWnWkrgNwKEaB+a5F7h6kfv+PNmIbiHtDLJbrKy70mpaSz/NUvAS+UKSii+WgoY4/+Ld6wAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/cd07d/Cover-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/46142/Cover-image.webp 125w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/81c3e/Cover-image.webp 250w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/cd07d/Cover-image.webp 500w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/bf95e/Cover-image.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":281}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/Cover-image.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/service-mesh-specifications/service-mesh-specifications-and-why-they-matter"}},{"id":"f3698102-848c-561d-bb18-e29be1e80e1f","body":"\n\n\nimport MesheryOperatorShot from \"./meshery-operator-v0.5.0.webp\";\nimport MesheryOperator from \"./meshery-operator-dark.svg\";\nimport MeshSync from \"./meshsync.svg\";\nimport MesheryDB from \"./meshery-database.svg\";\nimport MesheryAdapterLibrary from \"./meshery-adapter-library.svg\";\nimport Traefik from \"./traefik-mesh.svg\";\nimport MesheryExtensibility from \"./meshery-extensibility.svg\";\nimport NGINXSM from \"./nginx-service-mesh.svg\";\nimport layer5Logo from \"../../../../assets/images/layer5/layer5-only/svg/layer5-no-trim.svg\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<p><strong>We're pleased to announce the release of Meshery 0.5.0!</strong> Consisting of a number of significant architectural enhancements with 8 new capabilities entering alpha, Meshery v0.5.0's feature density is impressive.

Extension points allow you to  augment the behavior of Meshery by either adding entirely new capabilities or affecting the behavior of existing functionality, as see in the figure below.\n\n<div className=\"img-center\">\n  <a href={MesheryExtensibility} style={{backgroundColor: \"rgba(255,255,255,0)\"}}><img src={MesheryExtensibility} /></a>\n</div>\n\nAs you can see in the diagram, Meshery offers many types of extension points.\n\n- <strong>Extensible Service Mesh Adapters</strong> - bring your own service mesh.\n- <strong>Extensible APIs</strong> - bring your own GraphQL resolvers and expose new, custom endpoints.\n- <strong>Extensible Load Generators</strong> - Meshery supports three types of load generators, however, you can bring your own and plug it in.\n- <strong>Extensible Providers</strong> - the v0.5.0 release delivers dynamic injection of Remote Provider extensions. Providers are a powerful mechanism for integrating Meshery into your existing tooling and systems.\n\nThere are two types of Providers in Meshery: Local - built into Meshery and Remote - implemented by anyone or any organization that wishes to integrate with Meshery. Remote Provider extensibility includes:\n\n  * Pluggable UI functionality\n  * Pluggable Backend functionality\n  * Pluggable Authentication and Authorization\n  * Long-Term Persistence\n  * Enhanced Visualization\n  * Historical Reporting  \n\nLearn more about the platform Meshery provides to extend its funcionality by exploring its <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility\">extension points</Link>. If you have or are building your own <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility/providers\">Remote Provider</Link>, let us know!\n<h2>MeshKit and Meshery Adapter Library</h2>\n\nAs a service mesh toolkit, MeshKit aims to specifically focus on service mesh management and provides broadly useful functionality, it provides a standard policy for error handling and logging across all Meshery components, and implementations for error handling, logging, and tracing.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>MeshKit provides common data models of Service Mesh Interface conformance testing for Meshery.</li>\n  <li>The low-level API abstract by MeshKit to the high-level functions provides out-of-the-box functions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Meshery Adapter Library</h3>\n\n<p>The Meshery Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of functionality for managing the lifecycle of service meshes and their workloads.</p>\n<div className=\"img-center\">\n  <a href={MesheryAdapterLibrary}><img src={MesheryAdapterLibrary} /></a>\n</div>\n\n* The library provides a set of interfaces, some with default implementations like a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh-specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.\n* The default configuration provider we use Viper to reads the adapter specific configuration, and the configuration providers are implementations of an interface, this can be flexible if anyone wants to implement it on their own.\n\n<div className=\"intro\" style={{textAlign: \"center\", margin: \"2rem 4rem\"}}><p>Read <Link to=\"/community/members/michael-gfeller\">Maintainer Michael Gfeller</Link>'s blog post <Link to=\"/blog/meshery/introducing-meshkit-and-the-meshery-adapter-library\">Introduction MeshKit and the Meshery Adapter Library</Link> for more details.</p></div>\n\nWith the increasing the number and diversity of service meshes supported by Meshery, you might find the list of [Supported Service Meshes](https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes) a helpful, complete list.\n\n<h2>Meshery Operator</h2>\n<img style={{float: \"left\", maxWidth: \"300px\", width: \"20%\", padding: \"1.25rem\"}} src={MesheryOperator} />\n<p style={{display: \"block\", width: \"100%\"}}>\nAs a Kubernetes custom controller, Meshery Operator provides a Kubernetes-native approach to interfacing with Meshery. Kubernetes is where service meshes have gotten their initial foothold, and therefore, important that Meshery interface to Kubernetes natively.\n</p>\n<p>Some service meshes support non-containerized workloads outside of the cluster and will grow in this focus over time. While Meshery Operator is Kubernetes only in the v0.5.0 release, Meshery's arichitecture makes considerations for different workload and platform types.</p>\n\n<div style={{display: \"flex\", width: \"100%\"}}>\n  <div style={{textAlign: \"center\", flex: \"50%\"}}>\n    <a href={MesheryOperatorShot} style={{backgroundColor: \"rgba(255,255,255,0)\"}}><img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={MesheryOperatorShot} /></a>\n  </div>\n  <ul style={{flex: \"50%\"}}>\n    <li>Meshery Operator is the multi-service mesh operator that runs as a Kubernetes Operator and defines two custom resources: MeshSync and Meshery Broker (NATS)</li>\n    <li>Meshery Operator is provides abilities includes cluster discovery, service mesh discovery, and data streaming via NATS.</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3>MeshSync</h3>\n<p>MeshSync is available as a Kubernetes custom resource that provides tiered discovery and continual synchronization with Meshery Server as to the state of the Kubernetes cluster, service meshes, and their workloads.</p>\n\n<div style={{display: \"flex\"}}>\n<img style={{maxWidth: \"300px\", width: \"20%\", padding: \"1.25rem\"}} src={MeshSync} />\n<ul>\n\n  <li>MeshSync is one of a family of custom controllers within Meshery Operator and is the <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/meshsync\">heartbeat of Meshery</Link>, pumping information about service meshes and their workloads throughout Meshery's components.</li>\n  <li>MeshSync helps Meshery mesh with meshes by helping define a service mesh agnostic object model.</li>\n  <li>It provides ability to detect service meshes and services deployed on the cluster, and snapshot stored in-memory and refreshed periodically; \nmaintain the local snapshot of the cluster and refreshed periodically.</li>\n  <li>MeshSync These abilities above help Meshery operations more resilient.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n<h4>Relational Database</h4>\n\nMeshery's <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/database\">relational database</a> serves as a repository for MeshSync data, user preferences, and system settings.

Meshery relational database offers federated datasets for managing multiple Kubernetes cluster and multiple service meshes.\n\n<div className=\"img-center\">\n  <a href={MesheryDB}><img src={MesheryDB} /></a>\n</div>\n\n<p>Learn more and consider <a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshsync\">contributing</a> to MeshSync.</p>\n\n## GraphQL Support\n\nMeshery now supports <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture#meshery-operator-and-meshsync\">GraphQL instances</a> between Meshery UI and Meshery Server offering any GraphQL client the  power to ask for exactly what they need from mesh. This new API sets the stage preparing for  exciting features in upcoming releases. Extension points are also built into Meshery's GraphQL support allowing integrators to bring their own GraphQL resolvers to the Meshery server runtime.\n\n\n<h2>Meshery Command Line Interface Enhancements</h2>\nThe beloved `mesheryctl` introduces new commands in the v0.5.0 release expands the CLI's support of multiple Meshery deployments with the `context` command and control over when Meshery auto-updates with the `channel` command.\n\n<h3>Managing Multiple Meshery Deployments</h3>\nIntroduced in this release is the meshconfig - a configuration file that describes Meshery deployments in separate <i>contexts</i>. A Meshery <i>context</i> describes deployments across Docker hosts and Kubernetes clusters. <code>mesheryctl system context</code> enables user to easy manage multiple deployments of Meshery by quickly switching contexts. \n\n### Subscribing to Meshery Release Channels\n`mesheryctl system channel` allows you to easily set and switch between which Meshery release channel (stable or edge) that you want a particilar Meshery deployment (`context`) to use. Meshery deployments subscribe to one of two release channels and can either automatically self-update the deployment or prompt you to update the deployment. Alternatively, you can pin a given Meshery deployment to a specific release should you want tighter control over when Meshery updates. Read more about <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/build-and-release#release-channels\">Meshery's <i>stable</i> and <i>edge</i> release channels</Link>. \n\n\nReview the <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl\">mesheryctl Command Reference</Link> for details on all subcommands, flags, and their behavior.\n\n<h2>On to v0.6.0</h2>\n\nTo get a more comprehensive list of the bug fixes and enhancements packaged in the v0.5.0 release, see the [Meshery Documentation](https://docs.meshery.io/).

New releases for Meshery are published on a frequent cadence with new features and bug fixes. Today, we are announcing version 0.4.0 of Meshery. This summary highlights Meshery's latest developments and elucidates new features.\n\n## What's New?\n\nThe v0.4.0 release of Meshery introduces a plethora of new features and bug fixes across service mesh environments spanning Meshery and it's various adapters.\n\n### Meshery's CLI: `mesheryctl`\n**New Command Structure**<br/>\n`mesheryctl` commands and subcommands have been restructured in v0.4.0 into the categories:\n- Global Commands and Flags\n- Meshery Lifecycle Management\n- Performance Management\n- Service Mesh Lifecycle Management\n- Workload Lifecycle Management\n\nOrganizing commnands [under these categories](https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl) is done with both the intention to make `mesheryctl` functions intuitively at your fingertips, but also to make room for forthcoming functionality.\n\n**Exposing Performance Management in the CLI**<br/>\n`perf:` a new `mesheryctl`command. Introduction of new performance sub-commands, now benchmark your service mesh at the tip of your fingers using our new CLI command `perf`.\n\n**Support for Scoop** <br/>\nSupport extended to Scoop Bucket. You can now install mesheryctl on your Windows machine with Scoop Bucket. Visit the [Meshery Scoop Bucket](https://github.com/layer5io/scoop-bucket) to install Meshery on Windows.\n\n**Rename `cleanup` to `reset`**<br/>\nThe `cleanup` is used to reset your Meshery deployment configuration back to its default settings. This command has been renamed to `reset` to more appropriately reflect its purpose.\n\n### MeshSync<br/>\n<img src={operator} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"meshery-operator-dark\" />\n\n-  A component of the [Meshery Operator](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-operator), MeshSync can scan the environment to get the deployment details of specific types of service meshes and the connected Kubernetes cluster.\n-  MeshSync is a new component addition to Meshery. Meshery needs to be constantly updated given that service meshes and their underlying infrastructure are dynamic, constantly changing.  Meshery operations should be resilient in the face of this change.\n-  MeshSync brings a service mesh agnostic object model that defines relationships between all objects under management.\n\n### Meshery Adapter for Citrix Service Mesh (beta)<br/>\n\n<img src={MesheryArchitecture} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"meshery-architecture\" />\n\n- [Citrix Service Mesh](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-cpx) is now a supported service mesh. Meshery incorporates support for the Citrix ADC CPX, which is a cloud-ready, container-based application delivery controller that can be provisioned on a Docker host.\n- CPX runs as the Istio Data Plane component, displacing Envoy as the default data plane service proxy.<br/>\n\n### Security & Authentication\n\n- Meshery has moved from using session authentication to JWT authentication. Meshery's JWT authentication is powered by Hydra Auth.\n- You can now opt to authenticate yourself on mesheryctl while performing performance tests using `mesheryctl`, you can authenticate yourself by getting the JWT Token from Meshery UI.\n\n### Meshery Server\n\n- Support provided for [wrk2 as an alternative load generator](https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management#load-generators).\n- [Providers](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility) - A new project construct that allows users to select authentication, long-term storage etc.\n- Ad-hoc [connectivity tests for Prometheus and Grafana](https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management#grafana-and-meshery) are now supported.\n- Extraneous information beyond IP address and port in Grafana and Prometheus endpoints have been stripped off.\n\n### Meshery UI\n\n- ES-Lint has been added to the client side to ensure the quality of code and increase maintainaiblity of code.\n- Cypress has been set-up to enable end-to-end tests and integration tests for Meshery UI.\n\n<center><iframe frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowFullScreen={true} mozallowFullScreen=\"true\" webkitallowFullScreen=\"true\"frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowFullScreen={true} mozallowFullScreen=\"true\" webkitallowFullScreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds9D2KgZKxo\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></center>\n\n\n### Other notable changes\n\n- From within the [Meshery Continuous Integration Working Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds9D2KgZKxo&list=PL3A-A6hPO2IM7rYiKxG4l3eQNc6X3IUex), we have strengthened our continuous integration (CI) actions & tests by introducing new workflows like `static check`, `vet check`, `security check` for our server code.\n- ReleaseDrafter & WelcomeBot has been added to the repository to enable automation of release notes and for welcoming new contributors, respectively.\n\nTo get a more comprehensive list of the bug fixes and enhancements packaged in the v0.4.0 release, see the [Meshery Documentation](https://docs.meshery.io/project/releases)\n\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing Meshery v0.4.0","subtitle":"","date":"August 7th, 2020","author":"Layer5 Team","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsoAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSGYAAAABgCsAgIHqqtHm5JrcZNvWxqvd2GwbYz1u7yf5ARGR4N+JIZRCqIZQBSQ+aIdJPY+dC3seH6nRZlTtfN27zv5n8B0Vs5jm+2qmdSqD7LBa0lUQRfBdDgvPIlGJVCQJR0JTiTjw/wBWUDggPgAAADADAJ0BKhQADQA+0VakS6gko6GwCAEAGglpAAB60b/b/AAA/vAi9+Ax+ANYXYVXicTSFmjmW1J3l211gAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp","srcSet":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp 500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.666}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/meshery-v040.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsoAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSGYAAAABgCsAgIHqqtHm5JrcZNvWxqvd2GwbYz1u7yf5ARGR4N+JIZRCqIZQBSQ+aIdJPY+dC3seH6nRZlTtfN27zv5n8B0Vs5jm+2qmdSqD7LBa0lUQRfBdDgvPIlGJVCQJR0JTiTjw/wBWUDggPgAAADADAJ0BKhQADQA+0VakS6gko6GwCAEAGglpAAB60b/b/AAA/vAi9+Ax+ANYXYVXicTSFmjmW1J3l211gAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp","srcSet":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/b6c82/meshery-v040.webp 125w,\n/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/48571/meshery-v040.webp 250w,\n/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":333}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/meshery-v040.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/announcements/announcing-meshery-v040"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Projects"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1376321266","1485533831","2848499768","3205812809","4047814605","961506260"],"matchPath":"/blog/tag/projects"}
