To stay up to date with the latest Meshery features and updates, you can switch between different release channels.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Artifacts of the builds for Meshery and its components are published under two different release channels, so that improved controls may be provided to both  Meshery users and Meshery developers. The two release channels are edge and stable release channels. Relative to stable releases, edge releases occur much more frequently. Edge releases are made with each merge to master, unless that merge to master is for a stable release. Stable releases are made with each\n  merge to master when a GitHub release tag is also present in the workflow.\n</p>\n\n<h2> How release channels offer subscription </h2>\n<p>\n  Release Channels offers a subsciption where user can subscribe to a specific  release channel and get notified when a new release is available. This is  useful for users who want to stay up to date with the latest Meshery features, while also also providing flexibility for users who want to stay on a specific version of Meshery.\n  However, this approach can be risky because some updates may introduce bugs or compatibility issues that could break your existing installation. Depending upon your risk aversion and the nature of your deployment environment, having a subscription means that you will automatically receive these updates that you might not be ready incorporate. On the other hand, release channels also offer the ability to pin to a specific release which is a  good thing as it allows users to maintain stability and predictability of their environment by preventing unexpected changes from being introduced into their system. However, doing so cancels out any future subscription-based benefits such as receiving security patches or bug fixes that were added after that version was released.\n\nTherefore, it's important for you to weigh the pros and cons of each option before making decisions on how you want to manage your Meshery deployment. It's recommended you and your organizations have a well-defined upgrade strategy based on testing and validation procedures prior to applying new releases in production environments whether via subscriptions or manual upgrades to ensure that system availability is maintained and risks are minimized.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTo subscribe to a specific release channel or version using mesheryctl you can use \n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set [stable|stable-version|edge|edge-version] </code></pre>\nThis command will update your local Meshery configuration to use the selected channel for future updates. To set the channel to a specific version, replace Version with the desired version number. Example: <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set stable</code> or <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set stable-v0.5.56</code>\n</p>\n<h2> Switching between Release Channels</h2>\n<p>There are two ways to switch between Meshery release channels: using mesheryctl or by editing your meshconfig file. In this blog post, we'll cover both methods.</p>\n\n<h3>What is Meshconfig?</h3>\n<p>\n  Meshconfig is a configuration file that is used to configure Meshery. It is typically located in the <code>~/.meshery/config.yaml</code> directory. It contains information about the current release channel, the version of Meshery that is installed, and other configuration options that are specific to your Meshery installation. \n  Meshconfig is automatically generated when you run Meshery for the first time. It is also automatically updated when you update Meshery\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n<h3>Switching between Meshery release channels using meshconfig file.</h3>\n<p>Open your terminal and confirm that you have mesheryctl installed by running  <code>mesheryctl version</code>. If you don't have mesheryctl installed, you can install it by following the instructions in the  <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl\">Meshery documentation</a>.</p>\n<li>\nCreate new Meshery config.yaml file <pre><code className=\"language=bash\">mesheryctl system context create [context-name]</code></pre>\n</li>\nExample: <br/> <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context create new-context --components meshery-istio meshery-osm meshery-linkerd --platform docker --url http://localhost:9081 --set --yes </code>\n<li> To view the newly created meshery context use <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context view [context-name]</code></pre></li>\n<li>After making these changes, you can switch between different context by using <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context switch</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Switching between Meshery release channels using mesheryctl.</h3>\n<p>mesheryctl is a command-line tool for managing Meshery. You can use it to switch between different release channels. Here's how:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Run the following command to see the current configuration for Meshery:</li>\n<pre>\n<code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context view</code>\n</pre>\n<img src={MesheryVersion} className=\"image-center\"  style={{width: \"50%\"}}></img>\n<p>This will show you the currently channels ,<b>stable</b> or <b>edge</b>, along with the version number and other information.</p>\n<li>Run the following command to switch to a different release channel:</li>\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel switch</code></pre>\nThis command will update your meshconfig file to switch release channel and version of context in focus. To switch the channel to a specific version, replace <b>Version</b> with the desired version number.\n<li> To confirm that the channel has been changed, run the following command again: <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel view</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Conclusion </h2>\n\n<p>\n  Switching between Meshery release channels is a simple and straightforward process. You can do it using mesheryctl or by switching between your meshconfig file. Whether you want stable updates or bleeding-edge features, Meshery has a release channel that suits your needs. Just remember to carefully consider your use case and needs before making any changes to ensure that you have the best Meshery experience.\n</p>\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Changing

folks, </p>\n<p>As a contributor, each of us is always striving hard in the ocean to open more and more pull-requests, but being a contributor just doesn&#39;t mean only raising PRs, it also means reviewing other PRs, pointing out mistakes, helping others in improving the code-quality/code-reusability/code-readability, helping in finding missing edge-cases that haven&#39;t been tackled yet, giving your opinions, writing LGTM, CITY helps nothing but just improving the confidence and engagement of the PR author.</p>\n<p>So put on your <strong>Quality Tester</strong> hats because here I&#39;ll talk about how to test the PRs with the label <code>component/mesheryctl</code> i.e. pull-requests related to <code>mesheryctl</code></p>\n<p>Okay before we start, I&#39;ll like to tell you about <a href=\"https://github.com/cli/cli\">GitHub CLI</a>, it helps you checkout PRs very easily in your local system.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The very first step is to review the PR, suggest changes if you think of any, ask queries, help the author to improve the code quality/readability/reusability, ask questions because asking helps you learn asking more better questions next time.</p></li>\n<li><p>PR authors either attach a video showcasing expected behavior or add written instructions about their fix under <strong>User Acceptance Behavior</strong></p></li>\n<li>\n<p>Now it&#39;s the time to checkout PR in your local system, we can check out any PR like this</p>\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">gh pr checkout https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/4823</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can check if you&#39;re into the same branch as the PR author with </p>\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">git branch</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Well, if we&#39;re testing a PR related to mesheryctl, we need to build the binary from the same branch. change your directory to <code>mesheryctl</code> folder and run</p>\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">make</code></pre>\n<p>This will create a mesheryctl binary according to your OS in the same directory</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Now it&#39;s time to test out this newly built binary according to what&#39;s been tackled in the PR and related issues. For e.g. <code>system start</code> has some new functionality, make sure you followed the pull-request/linked-issue instruction for env setup, as sometimes fix/features are tackling an issue with a specific type of environment.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">./mesheryctl system start </code></pre>\n<p>the <code>./</code> helps us in using the newly built cli-binary present in the current directory which we built in 5th step</p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>make sure we have a similar experience as mentioned in the Video or the instructions added to the PR. but the wait is it okay to give green flags to the PR? not yet tbh. We as a tester should turn a little evil and think of the relevant situations/environments which might not have been tackled but should be(basically we&#39;re trying to break the new feature/fix)</li>\n<li>After spending a good amount of time testing the new behaviors, old standard behaviors, new test cases, few edge cases. We can provide new insights to the PR author about the behavior in your system, depending on our experience we can ask the PR author to address our new queries, or we can appreciate the work, or give green flags to the PR.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Wow, that was a ton of work there. well being a Tester is tough but very important before we merge pull requests. Every PR should be marked green with end-to-end testing before merging, we as a project are using GH Workflows to perform standard golang-testing but manual end-to-end testing completely removes margins of error.</p>\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Validating Meshery CLI Functionality","subtitle":"An introduction to testing mesheryctl","date":"June 10th, 2022","author":"Piyush Singariya","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRjoAAABXRUJQVlA4IC4AAADwAgCdASoUAAcAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwCdADBsAAD+8CVGzfndbE6d1gAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/16531/thumbnail.webp","srcSet":"/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/a4fab/thumbnail.webp 750w,\n/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/16baf/thumbnail.webp 1080w,\n/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/5eb4b/thumbnail.webp 1366w,\n/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/16531/thumbnail.webp 1895w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.36358839050131925}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/thumbnail.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRjoAAABXRUJQVlA4IC4AAADwAgCdASoUAAcAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwCdADBsAAD+8CVGzfndbE6d1gAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/abe74/thumbnail.webp","srcSet":"/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/83606/thumbnail.webp 125w,\n/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/ce4a2/thumbnail.webp 250w,\n/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/abe74/thumbnail.webp 500w,\n/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/1165c/thumbnail.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":182}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/9156c22b67aedb4c9c71f4951b06f17f/thumbnail.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/validating-meshery-cli-functionality"}},{"id":"d3755e16-1694-5614-8d5f-5fe6f590fc95","body":"\n\n\n\nimport oldDesign from \"./initial-design.webp\";\nimport newDesign from \"./mesheryctl-docs.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n<p>Documentation plays a major role in any project. Even if the project is small or too big, the creator or the team behind the project needs to curate the documentation very well such that it'll be useful for new end users to refer and learn to use the project, troubleshoot the problems occurred and lot more. Thus, we, Layer5 have curated the documentation for Meshery to meet such purposes. Not to mention, <code>mesheryctl</code>, the CLI client of Meshery needs a curated documentation as well. This blog describes about the evolution of <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page. </p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Initial Command Reference Design</h3>\n<p>\nThe initial design of <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page is all made using pure markdown and the functionality is handled using Jekyll, the main framework used for Meshery Docs. This handled great at initial stage but had many limitations, such as:\n    <ul>\n        <li>Updation of YAML for data is often required</li>\n        <li>Design was obselete at initial stage</li>\n        <li>No separate pages for each command and subcommand</li>\n    </ul>\n    Thus, the idea for redesigning the <code>mesheryctl</code> reference page was desperately needed.\n    </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\" alt=\"Meshery Documentation\" target=\"_parent\">\n    <img src = {oldDesign} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Initial design of mesheryctl command reference\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>Updated Command Reference Design</h3>\n<p>To tackle the shortcomings of the previous design, I was tasked to redesign the <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page entirely. This was a big task at first glance to me, as I was a new contributor back then. Eventually after manipulating the reference section with help of great folks, I was able to pull off the task and the design was updated. </p> \n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\" alt=\"Meshery Documentation\">\n<img src={newDesign} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Meshery CLI command reference\" /></a>\n</p>\n<p>The redesign work was done with help of HTML in markdown and with optimization in YAML code. A sample is given below.</p>\n\n```\n    <!-- Copy this template to create individual doc pages for each mesheryctl commands -->\n\n    <!-- Name of the command -->\n    # mesheryctl mesh\n\n    <!-- Description of the command. Preferably a paragraph -->\n    ## Description\n\n    {% assign name = site.data.mesheryctlcommands.cmds[page.command] %}\n    {{ name.description }}\n\n    <!-- Basic usage of the command -->\n    <pre className=\"codeblock-pre\">\n    <div className=\"codeblock\">\n    mesheryctl mesh [flags] \n    </div>\n    </pre>\n    ...........\n```\n\n<h3>Adding auto generation feature in reference</h3>\n<p>As time passed, we realized that the command reference missed something for a while, though the design has been changed. Then, we thought the idea of automating the generation of docs such that developers don't need to change the code in docs section while working towards <code>mesheryctl</code>. That's where we got to know that Cobra library (the library for CLI apps made using golang) has a feature to make doc pages automatically. So we decided to incorporate that feature into <code>mesheryctl</code> docs page as well! After making several changes and a PR, I was finally able to introduce the feature in the docs site!</p>\n\n```\nvar startCmd = &cobra.Command {\n\tUse:   \"start\",\n\tShort: \"Start Meshery\",\n\tLong:  `Start Meshery and each of its service mesh components.`,\n\tArgs:  cobra.NoArgs,\n\tExample: `\n// Start meshery\nmesheryctl system start\n// To create a new context for in-cluster Kubernetes deployments and set the new context as your current-context\nmesheryctl system context create k8s -p kubernetes -s\n// (optional) skip checking for new updates available in Meshery.\nmesheryctl system start --skip-update\n// Reset Meshery's configuration file to default settings.\nmesheryctl system start --reset\n// Silently create Meshery's configuration file with default settings\nmesheryctl system start --yes\n.....\n}\n\t`,\n```\n\n<p>Using this information provided above in each golang file, the markdown page is generated using Cobra CLI library and thus reducing the workload on the developer by automating via <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/.github/workflows/mesheryctl-ci.yml#L73\">GitHub Actions</a>.</p>\n<br />\n<p>This is so far on how the <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference is evolved for now. And I hope that it'll continue to evolve in the field of documentation to serve the users to use Meshery in best way possible.</p>\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Evolution of the Meshery CLI Command Reference","subtitle":null,"date":"June 9th, 2022","author":"Aadhitya Amarendiran","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABwBACdASoUAA0APtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJbACdMoGvtgJwx880HleA8ofTgAD+2VgctvGN2cFdfAJj4YJ0Ha8AiiMSiWh82G/yk9ZshKIR54QST0HBPk98AjqzxGHfuVZiMjvT9XDm39S3tEJ+oAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/f06bf/mesheryctl.webp 750w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/8c7d4/mesheryctl.webp 1080w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6316666666666667}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/mesheryctl.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABwBACdASoUAA0APtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJbACdMoGvtgJwx880HleA8ofTgAD+2VgctvGN2cFdfAJj4YJ0Ha8AiiMSiWh82G/yk9ZshKIR54QST0HBPk98AjqzxGHfuVZiMjvT9XDm39S3tEJ+oAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/704ce/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/5a879/mesheryctl.webp 125w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/6d26b/mesheryctl.webp 250w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/704ce/mesheryctl.webp 500w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/5c637/mesheryctl.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":316}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/mesheryctl.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/evolution-of-the-meshery-cli-command-reference"}},{"id":"5d6e85c1-a958-51c5-a20e-1308e5fd0237","body":"\n\n\n\nimport UnitTest from \"./unit-test.webp\";\nimport IntegrationTest from \"./integration-test.webp\";\nimport TreeGraph from \"./tree-graph.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"intro \">\n<p>Delivering a high quality user experience is our pinnacle goal in the design of Meshery's CLI: <code>mesheryctl</code>. Delivering a high quality user experience means testing both qualitatively and quantatively. As a concept, quality - whether you're talking about software or anything else - can be directly measured by consistency. A quality user experience is consistent and consistency of <code>mesheryctl</code> is reinforced by its many unit tests.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><code>mesheryctl</code> is written in Golang. In the Meshery project, we use CodeCov to calculate the code coverage across <code>mesheryctl</code>'s line of code. And there are plenty of lines of code. Achieving high percentages of code coverage in Meshery's CLI with grows in criticality as we bring more features into <code>mesheryctl</code> as a robust and sophisticated command line client of Meshery. Unit and integration tests bolster and roll up into broader end-to-end, functional testing performed across Meshery and the rest of its components. </p>\n\n<p>High levels of code coverage makes it easier for each project contributor to be confident that their code changes aren’t breaking any preexisting <code>mesheryctl</code> commands, side-swiping their functionality unknowingly, and consequently, unwittingly lowering the quality of Meshery's overall user experience.</p>\n\n<h3> mesheryctl lines of code</h3>\n\n\n```yaml\n\n    270 text files.\n    106 unique files.\n    166 files ignored.\n\n    cloc v 1.92  T=0.15 s (692.3 files/s, 110063.3 lines/s)\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Language       files          blank        comment           code\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Go                88           2128           1330          13045\n    YAML              12              0              0            215\n    JSON               4              0              0             42\n    make               1             10              2             31\n    Markdown           1             23              0             27\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    SUM:             106           2161           1332          13360\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n<p>Unit Tests can be written in two ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand\n        <ol>\n            <li>Mock Meshery(backend) response if needed</li>\n            <li>Grab console output</li>\n            <li>Store standard/verified mesheryctl output in a golden file(a text file)</li>\n            <li>Match the stored/expected output with what we grab from the console</li>\n            <li>Cover as many scenarios as possible, test the situations where errors must be thrown</li>\n            <li>This is a standard format, changes can be made accordingly</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> functions\n        <ol>\n            <li>This is the standard testing you may have come across in every project</li>\n            <li>You write one test dedicated to one function covering all possible test-cases, matching expected outputs</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Example tree graph</h3>\n<p>This example of a tree graph (from <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/4823\">meshery/meshery/pull/4823</a>) shows the impact given changes make on the level of code coverage.</p>\n\n<img src={TreeGraph} />\n\n<h3>Integration Tests</h3>\n\n<p>Integrations tests come into view when you cannot mock something easily and when a given behavior is cross-functional / cross-component. Integration tests put more, but not all of the focus validating system behavior and that the system completes all the necessary actions. Take <code>mesheryctl system start</code> for example. This command deploys Meshery, its adapters, and Kubernetes Operator; it starts Meshery. So, you run the command to start Meshery in a GitHub workflow and after running the <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand through the tests and make sure that Meshery actually started. And if the workflow successfully runs the test, then boom!, you aced your integration writing test... errr... test writing.</p>\n\n<p>The integration test writing exam can initially be challenging, but... that’s the fun in it. :) Running tests and making sure a command that is otherwise hard to verify, hard to test, and making it automatic through GH workflows.</p>\n\n<h3>How you can make an impact</h3>\n\n<p>Writing tests and making them work is in itself a tough task to do, so writing one test for a single function counts and makes a big difference over the long term. Don't hesitate. Start writing tests now. A single, new test is worthy of raising a pull request and will get you well on your way to learning much more about Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, and service meshes.</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://codecov.io/gh/meshery/meshery/\">Codecov</a> is used to check code coverage in <code>mesheryctl</code> (login with GitHub to get an in-depth idea of lines-of-code being covered in code coverage).</li>\n    <li>You can check the files on CodeCov’s website to figure out which mesheryctl commands haven’t been covered by existing tests.</li>\n    <li>Guide: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRlFpElRmybJ3WacgPKXgCSiQ2poJl3iCCV1dAalf0k/edit#heading=h.rzpmb66db1sq\">Writing tests for mesheryctl</a>. This guide will briefly introduce how tests are supposed to be written for mesheryctl.</li>\n    <li>Contributing to Tests doesn’t always mean writing new tests, It also means improving the effectiveness of already written-ones.</li>\n    <li> Search for Issues marked with area/tests in <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery\">GitHub - meshery/meshery</a>: Meshery, the cloud native management plane.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The impact that you make with by writing even a single test is quite high. Your tests will be executed and used time-and-time again. I can’t explain in words (I don’t have that good of a vocabulary). Your Tests are going to run in each pull request raised against the Meshery project, in each commit someone pushes to a pull request, in every nightly regression test suite, in every release. Just think: if another contributor incidently introduces a defect or doesn't consider for an edge case, and fails to uphold the intended behavior of the code, your tests are going to catch them redhanded. How cool is that?</p>\n\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? Jump in and write a few tests today! When you raise your pull request, label it with <code>area/tests</code> and <code>component/mesheryctl</code> and I'll be there to review! Let’s get <code>mesheryctl</code> 100% code coverage badge.</p>\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"How to write unit and integration tests for mesheryctl","subtitle":null,"date":"January 6th, 2022","author":"Piyush Singariya","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRjoAAABXRUJQVlA4IC4AAADwAgCdASoUAAcAPtFUo0uwJKMhsAgCABoJaQDImC0kAAD+8jqXyPcoCEgyAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/228cadb307e48d8dd59978517c9862a3/45e9e/integration-test.webp","srcSet":"/static/228cadb307e48d8dd59978517c9862a3/0622a/integration-test.webp 750w,\n/static/228cadb307e48d8dd59978517c9862a3/56413/integration-test.webp 1080w,\n/static/228cadb307e48d8dd59978517c9862a3/28a59/integration-test.webp 1366w,\n/static/228cadb307e48d8dd59978517c9862a3/45e9e/integration-test.webp 1882w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.35281615302869285}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/228cadb307e48d8dd59978517c9862a3/integration-test.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRjoAAABXRUJQVlA4IC4AAADwAgCdASoUAAcAPtFUo0uwJKMhsAgCABoJaQDImC0kAAD+8jqXyPcoCEgyAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/228cadb307e48d8dd59978517c9862a3/f82b7/integration-test.webp","srcSet":"/static/228cadb307e48d8dd59978517c9862a3/3b9b0/integration-test.webp 125w,\n/static/228cadb307e48d8dd59978517c9862a3/6c123/integration-test.webp 250w,\n/static/228cadb307e48d8dd59978517c9862a3/f82b7/integration-test.webp 500w,\n/static/228cadb307e48d8dd59978517c9862a3/e30b3/integration-test.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":176}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/228cadb307e48d8dd59978517c9862a3/integration-test.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/how-to-write-unit-and-integration-tests-for-mesheryctl"}},{"id":"58ae43e0-f0b0-5c61-ab4f-b71e722508cc","body":"\n\n\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n### Introduction to Meshery\n\nFor all those who are unaware of <a href=\"/meshery\">Meshery</a>, Meshery is a multi-service mesh management plane which provides users with service mesh operational best practices, lifecycle and configuration management, but also interoperates between various service meshes, while enabling you with the tools and knowledge to glean the most of out your service mesh performance, while keeping your overhead to a minimum.\n\nMeshery's vision is to make the operating of any service mesh layer of cloud infrastructure simplified, and to hasten the inevitable, eventual, ubiquituous adoption service meshes as a pervasively present layer of any the way that any modern workload is designed and deployed. Meshery is created by the <Link to=\"/community\">Layer5</Link>.\n\nLayer5 is a community-first, service mesh company which has technology <Link to=\"/partners\">partnerships</Link> with various tech giants like Microsoft, HashiCorp, CNCF, RedHat and many more to enlist. The community consists of open source leaders like maintainers of trending open-source projects, Google SoCers, Docker Captains, service mesh maintainers, Cloud Native Ambassadors and many more (<a href=\"http://slack.layer5.io\">join in!</a>).\n\n\n### What is mesheryctl?\n\nMeshery provides you with a clean, robust, streamlined command-line interface to manage and benchmark your service meshes, `mesheryctl`. With `mesheryctl`, not only you can manage your adapters & containers but you can also benchmark your mesh using the command line. `mesheryctl` provides support to a number of platforms so that we never miss out users. `mesheryctl` can be installed with a single bash command by simply executing:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n````\n\nin your terminal. You will see Meshery getting installed & fired up on port: 9081.\nYou will see the output as\n\n\n```\nExtracting mesheryctl-v0.3.14...\nArchive:  /Users/user/meshery.zip\n  inflating: LICENSE\n  inflating: README.md\n  inflating: mesheryctl\n\nInstalling mesheryctl in /usr/local/bin.\nmesheryctl installed.\npermissions moved to user\nRemoving installation files and opening Meshery...Updating Meshery now...\nPulling meshery          ... download complete\nPulling meshery-istio    ... done\nPulling meshery-linkerd  ... done\nPulling meshery-consul   ... done\nPulling meshery-octarine ... done\nPulling meshery-nsm      ... done\nPulling meshery-cpx      ... done\nPulling watchtower       ... done\n```\n\nand you will be able to see the Meshery UI on `https://localhost:9081`.\n\nIf you are wondering if bash is only way to get `mesheryctl`, then here is the list of platforms which you can get `mesheryctl describing all the different ways to get it.\n\n<table className=\"table-1\" align=\"center\">\n<thead>\n    <tr>\n    <th align=\"left\">Platform</th>\n    <th >Supported?</th>\n    </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <td ><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/docker\">Docker</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/docker\">Docker - Docker App</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/kubernetes\">Kubernetes</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/aks\">Kubernetes - AKS</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Kubernetes - Docker Desktop</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/eks\">Kubernetes - EKS</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/gke\">Kubernetes - GKE</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/kubernetes#helm\">Kubernetes - Helm</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/minikube\">Kubernetes - Minikube</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - Kubernetes - OpenShift</td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">In Progress</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Linux</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Mac</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl#homebrew\">Mac - Homebrew</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/windows\">Windows</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl#scoop\">Scoop</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/windows#wsl\">WSL2</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td>Raspberry Pi</td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">In Progress</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<br/>\nWe believe we have not missed any of the popular platforms for what it’s worth, we will be rolling out support for RaspberryPi and OpenShift soon 🎉🎉🎉.\n\nIf you are thinking about the requirements you would have to run `mesheryctl`, so to your surprise, to successfully run `mesheryctl` you will only need :\n\n<table align=\"center\" className=\"table-box\"><tbody><tr><td className=\"text-centre\">a running Docker daemon</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n### Into the MesheryCTL\n\nOnce you have successfully installed, you will be having the power of a new CLI Command MesheryCTL. As you type `mesheryctl` into your terminal, you will be shown with the various sub-commands and flags `mesheryctl` can support.\n\n```\nMeshery is the cloud native management plane, providing lifecycle, performance, and configuration management of service meshes and their workloads.\n\nUsage:\n  mesheryctl [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:\n  help        Help about any command\n  perf        Performance Management\n  system      Meshery Lifecyle Management\n  version     Print mesheryctl version\n\n\nFlags:\n      --config string    config file (default location is: $HOME/.meshery//meshery.yaml)\n  -h, --help            help for mesheryctl\n  -v, --version         Version of mesheryctl\n\nUse \"mesheryctl [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\n```\n\nOnce you do `mesheryctl system start`, Meshery will pull its adapters and latest docker images. Meshery will also detect your Kubernetes configuration and will let you know if Kubernetes is running. Meshery will run it’s web-based user interface on localhost port `9081` and will let you select your choice of <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility#providers\">Provider</a> before you can start managing your service meshes with this powerful utility.\n\n<table align=\"center\" className=\"table-box\"><tbody><tr><td className=\"text-centre\">One of the most interesting sub-commands of <code>mesheryctl</code> is <strong><code>perf</code></strong>.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nThe `perf` subcommand enables you to being managing the performance of your service mesh deployment and your workloads running atop of them. It lets you benchmark your service mesh without using the Meshery UI from the command line interface itself. Once you type `mesheryctl perf`, it will present you with all the powerful flags you can control with CLI, including providing it with a `--file` flag that points to any of a number of performance test profiles that you may have saved.\n\n```\nPerformance Management and Benchmarking using Meshery CLI.\n\nUsage:\n  mesheryctl perf --[flags]\n\nAvailable Flags for Performance Command:\n  name[string]                  (optional) A short descriptor to serve as reference for this test. If not provided, a random name will be generate.\n  url[string]                   (required) URL endpoint to send requests.\n  duration[string]              (required) Length of time to perform test (e.g 30s, 15m, 1hr). See standard notation https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration\n  load-generator[string]        (optional) Name of load generator to be used to perform test (default: \"fortio\")\n  mesh[string]                  (optional) Name of the service mesh to be tested (default: \"None\")\n  provider[string]              (required) Choice of Provider (default: \"Meshery\")\n  concurrent-requests[string]   (optional) Number of parallel requests to be sent (default: \"1\")\n  qps[string]                   (required) Queries per second (default: \"0\")\n  file[string]                  (optional) file containing SMPS-compatible test configuration. See https://github.com/layer5io/service-mesh-performance-specification\n  help                          Help for perf subcommand\n\nurl, duration, concurrent-requests, and qps can be considered optional flags if specified through an SMPS compatible yaml file using --file\n```\n\nAn example usage of `mesheryctl perf --[flags]` can be\n\n```bash\n mesheryctl perf --name \"a quick stress test\" --url http://192.168.1.15/productpage --qps 300 --concurrent-requests 2 --duration 30s --token \"provider=Meshery\"\n```\n\nYou can also provide a SMPS Configuration file with `perf` subcommand, with this file provided you will not have to specify url, duration, concurrent-requests & qps. However, if specified the value provided through file will be over-rided by value through CLI.

[Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery), which is the multi-service mesh management plane.\n2. [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d), which is used to create a dockerized [k3s](https://k3s.io) server.\n\nAnd, what really appealed to me about both of them is that everything from the installation to the usage was just *simple!*\nAnd cream on the top, both softwares are used with or inside containers, making each ideal for a create/try/delete workflow.\n\n<h4>Environment Setup</h4>\n\nBefore we start having *real* fun with Meshery, I will quickly list the different components I used for this blog post and ensure I define what could be optional for your own setup:\n1. [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery)\n2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)\n    - Docker is of course mandatory and as Meshery is based on a Compose file, which means that [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is also mandatory.\n3. [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d)\n    - k3d or any k3s/K8s cluster that you might have already configured.\n4. [WSL2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/)\n    - For the (few) ones who know me, my \"OS base\" is WSL2, which means that without much/any change, it should run fine for any Linux/MacOS setup.\n5. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) *(optional)*\n    - Grafana is not mandatory however is strongly recommend. We will setup a dockerized instance, but feel free to plug Meshery with your existing instance.\n\n<h4> Nothing is taken for granted </h4>\n\nFor the sake of making the blog post around Meshery, I won't explain how to install each component and will focus only on getting k3d and Meshery working.\n\nThat said, I do not take anything for granted and as Scott Hanselman once taught me: there is no \"just have to ...\" or \"by simply doing ...\".\n\nIf you face any issue with your setup (hopefully WSL2), just let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nunixtech) or on the [Layer5 Slack channel](http://slack.layer5.io).\n\n<h4>Meshery Installation</h4>\n\nFor the following steps, I will use the Ubuntu 18.04 WSL2 distro:\n\n- Start docker and confirm it's running:\n\n```bash\nsudo service docker start\ndocker version\n```\n\n- Using Docker, install Meshery on your local machine by running the following:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n```\n<a href={wsldockerstart}>\n    <img src={wsldockerstart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wsl-docker-start\" />\n</a>\n\n- Create a new k3d cluster with the <code> WSL2 IP </code>\n\n```bash\nexport mainIP=`hostname -I | awk '{ print $1 }'`\nk3d list\nk3d create --workers 3 --api-port ${mainIP}:6443\nexport KUBECONFIG=\"$(k3d get-kubeconfig --name='k3s-default')\"\nkubectl cluster-info\n```\n\n<a href={wslk3dstart}>\n    <img src={wslk3dstart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslk3dstart\" />\n</a>\n<br/>\n- Start Meshery on the newly created cluster\n\n```bash\nmesheryctl system start\n```\n\n<a href={wslmesherystart}>\n    <img src={wslmesherystart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslmesherystart\" />\n</a>\n- Once Meshery is fully started, login in your preferred browser using the <code>WSL2 IP</code> instead of <code>localhost</code>\n\n```bash\nexport BROWSER=/mnt/c/Firefox/firefox.exe\n$BROWSER $mainIP:9081 &\n```\n\n<a href={wslmesherylogin}>\n        <img src={wslmesherylogin} alt=\"wslmesherylogin\" />\n</a>\n<a href={wslmesheryloginsuccess}>\n    <img src={wslmesheryloginsuccess} alt=\"wslmesheryloginsuccess\" />\n</a>\n\n\n#### [Optional] More analytics with Grafana\nAs stated above, Meshery can leverage the analytics provided by Grafana. For this blog post, as everything is built from scratch. Here is the setup for a new Grafana dockerized instance.\n\nStart a new Grafana on docker instance\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n-d \\\n-p 3000:3000 \\\n--name=grafana \\\n-e \"GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL=http://$mainIP\" \\\n-e \"GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=MesheryInstance\" \\\ngrafana/grafana\n```\n\n<a href={wslgrafanastart}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanastart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanastart\" />\n</a>\n\n- Access the new instance with the admin password that you set in the docker environment variable\n```bash\n$BROWSER $mainIP:3000 &\n```\n\n<a href={wslgrafanalogin}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanalogin} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanalogin\" />\n</a>\n<br />\n<a href={wslgrafanaloginsuccess}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanaloginsuccess} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanaloginsuccess\" />\n</a>\n\n### An inside look\nWhile everything should run fine, it's always good to have a look at what has been deployed.\n\nIn this case, we are almost exclusively working with Docker and the \"inside look\" should look something like this:\n\n<a href={wslmesherycomplete}>\n    <img src={wslmesherycomplete}className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslmesherycomplete\" />\n</a>\n\n#### Conclusion\nAs [Lee Calcote](https://twitter.com/lcalcote) put it, this is a lot of buzz words: Meshery > k3s (deployed via k3d) > Docker > WSL2 > Windows 10. And he's totally right, still the \"beauty\" here, is that it \"simply works\".\n\nSince the begin of the Docker era, new tooling has appeard for simplifying complex workflows.\nEven Kubernetes (K8s) as a much lighter version with k3s by Rancher.\n\nAnd of course, Meshery which integrates and simplifies the installation and benchmarking of different service meshes. Hope you had fun assembling all these pieces and stay tunned for the \"Bonuses\", more fun to come!\n\n<span> > > > <i>Nunix out</i></span>\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Getting started with Meshery, WSL2 and k3d","subtitle":"","date":"July 9th, 2019","author":"Nuno do Carmo","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrgAAABXRUJQVlA4IKwAAAAwBQCdASoUABQAPtFgqU+oJSOiKAgBABoJagDHMywTmwXkh8XuWw62pPgeLa6iGOkYAAD+9R4SKH1oL6udrBkwr5rrkLRIeudVijKFQQi4NBpAgn1GqiLKGll7/coQQQ8X2m4ARFICZ1eH4EKwlMH79KOgYAEP9qeZU1fXG+Jmj3mSYoA/SF+9X/WI4UZXzEZSPBXefiBldNQhjxeWdjq9FujdEnATM/mAAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp 400w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/cnab-logo.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrgAAABXRUJQVlA4IKwAAAAwBQCdASoUABQAPtFgqU+oJSOiKAgBABoJagDHMywTmwXkh8XuWw62pPgeLa6iGOkYAAD+9R4SKH1oL6udrBkwr5rrkLRIeudVijKFQQi4NBpAgn1GqiLKGll7/coQQQ8X2m4ARFICZ1eH4EKwlMH79KOgYAEP9qeZU1fXG+Jmj3mSYoA/SF+9X/WI4UZXzEZSPBXefiBldNQhjxeWdjq9FujdEnATM/mAAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/d8057/cnab-logo.webp 100w,\n/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/2e34e/cnab-logo.webp 200w,\n/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/cnab-logo.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/getting-started-with-meshery-wsl2-and-k3d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"mesheryctl"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1376321266","1485533831","2848499768","3205812809","4047814605","961506260"],"matchPath":"/blog/tag/mesheryctl"}
