I used to find it fascinating how computer programs operate because they have such a tremendous impact on their users. This has always motivated me to work in the field of computers.\n\nAs I grew up, I was introduced to a broad spectrum of coding languages that enabled us to make the software that we used on the computer. These languages piqued my interest even more. I started exploring and made projects. The more I understood them, the more interesting they got. Slowly I realized that I don’t want to make projects that satisfy just my needs. I want to build something that will be on the internet and will be used by people around the world. With this goal in my mind, I started exploring and hit a gemstone that is open source. I would be working on real-world programming solutions that will be used by people all around the world. This helped me to get started and got me excited about contributing to open source projects. \n\n### First PR at Layer5 \nI still remember the first issue I worked on for Layer5 was the auto labeler on a pull request. I spotted a <code>[good first issue](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+)</code> tag and expressed interest in working on it despite not knowing what the task was. The issue required knowledge of GitHub Actions, something I was unaware of at the time. After getting the issue assigned, I started researching what GitHub Actions were. I found out that these actions helped automate workflows to build, test, and deploy software. After getting the basics down, I checked if there were any existing GitHub Actions for the auto labeling of the PR. To my surprise, there were a couple of them. \n\nSo before actually making a PR, I experimented with the actions extensively in my private repo. I remember making about 20-25 PR in my private repo to get the auto labeler working fine. After verifying that I got the desired results, I made a PR. I also got to discuss my approach in the [Meshery Development Call](https://layer5.io/community/calendar). I was so nervous at that time since that was the first meeting I attended where I had to make people understand what I did and the strategies I used. I was quite thrilled when my code got merged. I was enthralled to see that my code was working and being useful to the community. This motivated me to make more and more contributions. \n\n<img src={aadityaFirstPr} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Aaditya's first PR merged\" />\n\n### A Journey Never to forget \n\nMy Layer5 journey began with this small issue. I gradually started learning more about the projects and made some impactful contributions. I started to engage in the community more prominently. With the help of these contributions, I learned new technologies and techniques. Contributing to the codebase gave me so much exposure to React.js, which would not have been possible if I had done it on my own. I took up issues that used React.js and started solving them, and in no time, I was comfortable with it. I am thankful that I didn’t wait for me to learn more about react and then start contributing. I have always applied this principle, learning more by doing actual stuff rather than sitting there and getting stuck in the tutorial loop. \n\nAnother new technology I discovered was Jekyll, a static site generator. I was unfamiliar with this technology as well. I started contributing to issues involving Jekyll and slowly understood the basics and how the language works. I was very happy that I was able to make the [compatibility matrix](https://docs.meshery.io/project/compatibility-matrix), using Jekyll. Even my project for <Link to=\"/programs/gsoc\">GSoC</Link> is written in Jekyll. So, going from not knowing what Jekyll is, to making some big changes, did make me happy.  \n\nThe community also helped me boost my confidence. The weekly meetings are responsible for this. The way the meetings required me to explain my fixes and give updates regarding the issues I was working on, helped me get vocal and comfortable with talking to various people. \n\n<img src={aadityaPresenting} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Aaditya Presenting\" /> \n\nI am excited to be accepted as a <Link to=\"/programs/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</Link> Intern for this Summer of 2022. I am looking forward to contributing more and making an impact here. The project assigned to me is to create a dashboard on <a href=\"https://smp-spec.io/dashboard\">SMP Website</a>. Results from the [CNCF Cluster labs](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action/actions) will be displayed here graphically.  I wish to learn more about cloud native technologies and make contributions on the backend too. I also want to state that this will not be the end. I will be engaged with this community as long as I can and will try to give back as much as I can. \n\n### Appreciation for the Community \n\nFinally, I would like to thank the Layer5 Community for always being so supportive whenever I needed it. I took away a very significant lesson from this experience, there is always something to learn, and there is no harm in asking questions if you don't know the answer. It’s kinda hard to find such a welcoming community. There was not a day that I felt completely lost here, and that is what I adore about this community.\n\nKeep Meshing. Thank you.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My Journey as a Contributor to GSoC Intern at Layer5","subtitle":"Nothing but a magical experience","date":"July 6th, 2022","author":"Aaditya Narayan Subedy","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnoAAABXRUJQVlA4IG4AAAAQBACdASoUAAkAPtFWpUwoJKOiMAgBABoJaAC7ACPyR1T/wCrwBh0AAADieh27WAyux9DtURSUFpmQdMO1pe//vlTfTku3IEaYnRD3EMn9HESus+wI8Qk0fzA1B+joH6o+Ef/jFPEen2l/gsAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/7a906/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 750w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.45185185185185184}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnoAAABXRUJQVlA4IG4AAAAQBACdASoUAAkAPtFWpUwoJKOiMAgBABoJaAC7ACPyR1T/wCrwBh0AAADieh27WAyux9DtURSUFpmQdMO1pe//vlTfTku3IEaYnRD3EMn9HESus+wI8Qk0fzA1B+joH6o+Ef/jFPEen2l/gsAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/b2bde/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/7b988/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 125w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/f2ef5/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 250w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/b2bde/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 500w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/dcb7d/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":226}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/my-journey-as-a-contributor-to-gsoc-intern-at-layer5"}},{"id":"6f2b2a4d-337b-556e-9b63-7f45ddf1d976","body":"\n\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nIt all started with my curiosity to find an open-source project with open issues with DevOps and CI/CD labels on them. \nWhile I was searching that on GitHub, I found <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>, one of the projects at Layer5. I started going through the \n[README](https://github.com/meshery/meshery#readme), and it just felt like that is it. \nIt integrates with all kinds of technologies that I ever wanted to learn and explore. Then I jumped onto their [slack](http://slack.layer5.io/) and got even \nmore excited by the enthusiasm and energy of each community members welcoming me in the newcomers channel. I started attending all the community meetings and \nlearned about the project through the demos/updates from fellow contributors. Slowly and gradually, I started contributing too, then delivering updates in the \ncommunity calls, and consequently started climbing the contributor ladder.\n\nWhen I realised that I would be working on [Meshery Cloud](https://meshery.layer5.io) and <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> as an LFX intern at Layer5, then I couldn't control my excitement. \nThat excitement was to ship more impactful features for the Layer5 projects, work and engage more deeply with the engineering team at Layer5 and have an overall \nupliftment of my development skills.  Throughout my internship I worked on several features. Few on the top of the list are as follows, expanding \n[Meshery extension points](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility), exposing node details of the K8s clusters on which Meshery runs <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">performance tests</Link>, \nsupporting [Cilium service mesh adapter](https://github.com/meshery/meshery-cilium) with Meshery, persisting <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> user preferences with \nMeshery Cloud, migrating Meshery Cloud UI to NextJS, support for user profile on Meshery Cloud and exposing performance profiles \n(generated from Meshery performance tests that run on CNCF hosted runners through [meshery-smp-action](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action)) \nthrough a public facing API.\n\nIn terms of the learning curve, I learned so much that the knowledge I gained in the past three months overpowers the education I received in the last two years of college, \nif we put in context the applicability of each of the learnings in the software industry. \nI learned and applied the tech stack from Golang, GraphQL, and NextJS to Postgres, SQL, and GoBuffalo to GitHub actions. I got introduced to the topics like \nperformance engineering, service meshes, networking, and several cloud-native tool. While at the same time, I met several experienced developers who are very involved in \nthe communities which revolve around these realms.\n\nOne of the major realizations I got through this internship was that it is okay to make mistakes. There were a few instances where I made mistakes. \nFor instance, once I forgot to add pagination in an SQL query which depressed the whole production instance of Meshery Cloud, which means no one would be able \nto log into Meshery until that gets fixed. Or once I unknowingly used an incorrect default SSH port in a workflow that failed a GitHub action responsible for \npushing the latest Meshery Cloud image to Docker Hub and then updating the deployment in AWS VM. But that was okay, and no one got mad at me, but rather I have \nalways received constructive feedback. I did learn from each mistake and made sure that I dont repeat it because that is all that matters.\n\nI had a great time as an intern @ Layer5. Each day brought new challenges and a desire to raise PRs with great features. I not only learned how to fix bugs but also \nlearned how to avoid them in the first place. I not only learned hard skills but also learned soft skills. I not only learned the meaning of self-reliance but also learned \nthe true meaning of team spirit. All in all, that was one of the most exquisite experiences I have ever had and ofcourse, the best internship experience \n(considering it was my first internship ever!). \n\nI will be engaged in this community and will keep contributing to Layer5 projects as much as possible.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"LFX Experience at Layer5 - Pranav Singh","subtitle":"An exquisite experience","date":"June 8th, 2022","author":"Pranav Singh","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqIAAABXRUJQVlA4IJYAAACQBACdASoUABMAPtFcqE4oJSQiKAqpABoJYwAD5AjYMLV0rWndMa436sJRUEAA+djEu3IudfT7alQ2p1FNLw5yRf0MGfFZ9VoV/PxezqLUTaMQbqA/0AnQSTsU2j2QxZ8p/gcT0SQ1C+lcW81EyDaiAhX5zsCOXrKtwYDqyDSCgmcETkVeqBYWeNVZ9MpBLceccAWk6AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp","srcSet":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/fa57f/lfx-pranav.webp 750w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.96875}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/lfx-pranav.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqIAAABXRUJQVlA4IJYAAACQBACdASoUABMAPtFcqE4oJSQiKAqpABoJYwAD5AjYMLV0rWndMa436sJRUEAA+djEu3IudfT7alQ2p1FNLw5yRf0MGfFZ9VoV/PxezqLUTaMQbqA/0AnQSTsU2j2QxZ8p/gcT0SQ1C+lcW81EyDaiAhX5zsCOXrKtwYDqyDSCgmcETkVeqBYWeNVZ9MpBLceccAWk6AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/be316/lfx-pranav.webp","srcSet":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/41f72/lfx-pranav.webp 125w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/8be43/lfx-pranav.webp 250w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/be316/lfx-pranav.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":484.00000000000006}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/lfx-pranav.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/lfx-experience-at-layer5-pranav-singh"}},{"id":"e53b3eb0-0923-51eb-837a-f8d12f5a7fe8","body":"\r\n\r\n\r\nimport mentees from \"./mentees.webp\"\r\nimport meshmate from \"../../../../assets/images/meshmate/meshmate-icon.svg\"\r\n\r\n<BlogWrapper>\r\n\r\n<div className=\"intro\">\r\n<p>\r\nTo newbies, open source contributions may seem daunting. In much the same way that non-techies develop a reverence for programmers courtesy of the film industry’s portrayal of them as wizards whose brains magically sprout up elaborate mathematical models and whose mouths eloquently spew technological jargon, so do newbies perceive contributors: a bunch of techies who debug in seconds, recite programming language documentation by heart and, well, create pull requests in their sleep (this is a bit exaggerated, but you get the point). \r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n  <p>\r\n  This perception diminished any notion of our Stack Overflow and W3Schools-dependent selves ever having a shot at open source contribution. It often felt as if we haven’t attained the required caliber of ‘techie-ness’ requisite to join the erudite army of programming soldiers; that our match and stomps wouldn’t match the rhythm of these valiant sergeants. \r\n  </p>\r\n  \r\n  <img src={mentees} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"layer5 mentees\" />\r\n  <p>\r\n  However, <a href=\"https://shecodeafrica.org/programs/contributhon-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">She Code Africa’s Contributhon</a> program deconstructs this perception, moreso for women, by partnering with open source organizations like Layer5 and offering women the opportunity to receive mentorship that eases them into being ardent contributors.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  After a rigorous selection process, we:\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oyindawodu\">Oyindamola Dawodu</a>, Frontend Developer\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edmucious\">Ednah Akoth</a>, Frontend Developer \r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  gained entry into SCA’s second contributhon program and would like to immerse you in the voyage that the contributhon program was through this article.\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <h3>The Leaderboard Project</h3>\r\n  <p>\r\n  For 8 weeks, we have had the chance to immerse ourselves into Layer5’s open source contribution community by curating a leaderboard for <a href=\"https://discuss.layer5.io\">Layer5’s discussion forum</a> to show the most active participants based on various metrics such as likes received and posts created.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  We built this leaderboard to encourage more intentional communication and exert positive peer pressure on community members, thereby subconsciously incentivising them to give more solutions to problems discussed on the forum, and actively engage with content posted by other members\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  The project has presented an immersive learning experience for us, right from learning how to navigate using the ubuntu terminal, learning how to set up a local discourse development environment and render web pages,  examining the discuss API documentation and understanding the API endpoints needed to fetch the required data and designing the UI (User Interface) of the leaderboard. \r\n  </p>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Challenges We Faced</h3>\r\n  <p>\r\n  Getting acclimated to the intricacies of the discourse development environment has been no easy feat. There were moments where we stared at code on discourse in utter oblivion on its purpose or functionality, or faced version issues that impeded our discourse instance’s ability to run. It sometimes got even more frustrating when something as simple as a fetch instruction that you have been writing for almost the entirety of your programming life fails to work and none of the Stack Overflow fixes work. \r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  This question kept us going; How would we become the ardent <em>while in their sleep bug fixers</em> and prolific contributors if we don’t build the fortitude to weather such disheartening moments?\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n   During moments like these, the Layer5 community, particularly <Link to=\"/community/meshmates\">MeshMates</Link> and our mentors often saved the day, sharing resources or offering explanations on what ought to be done to salvage the situations.\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Lessons We Learned Along the Way</h3>\r\n  <p>\r\n  Overall, the journey has exercised and built upon our skills repertoire in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Version Control, and induced us into the contribution workflow, right from finding an open issue to work on, setting up the required environment to developing the solution. \r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  Furthermore, receiving feedback from both our mentors and members of the Layer5 community with regards to matters like the scalability of our data fetch methods, potential misuse of the leaderboard metrics to gain advantage, the converse outcome that our leaderboard could have (dishearten new members form contributing due to the seemingly low chance of their input reflecting on the board), more responsive UI fixes among others, helped us to become even more cognizant of the idea that we are developing not just for ourselves and our portfolios, but for a wider and greater audience.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  We became more abreast with the idea of developing for a community or for a greater purpose and the imperative role of feedback in that development process. We became more comfortable with the idea that we essentially do not own the product despite all the sweat we pour into it; we are instead a part of a larger community that comes together to build a widely suitable, sustainable and inclusive product. \r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <h3>Appreciation</h3>\r\n  <p>\r\n  Through building this leaderboard for Layer5’s Community Forum, we have assimilated ourselves into the glorious match of soldiers that previously intimidated us. We stepped foot into the previously deemed insidious territory of open source contribution and realised that we too have a lot to offer in this ecosystem. \r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  We have discovered a community of competent, supportive and serial problem-solvers, right from our mentors: \r\n  </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <Link to=\"https://layer5.io/community/members/ekene-leonard-nwobodo\"><img src={meshmate} style={{height: \"1.25rem\"}} /> Ekene Leonard Nwobodo</Link>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/etienejames5\">Etiene James</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <Link to=\"/community/members/ruth-ikegah\">Ruth Ikegah</Link>\r\n    </li>\r\n     <li>\r\n      <Link to=\"/community/members/atinuke-oluwabamikemi-kayode\">Oluwabamikemi Kayode</Link>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>\r\n   to the entirety of the contributors, a knowledge powerhouse that we look forward to continue contributing and building towards.\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <p>\r\n  Additionally, we would like to convey hearty regards to <a href=\"https://shecodeafrica.org/\">She Code Africa</a> for availing this program as a stepping stone to women like us to get started in OSS.

My inner voice asked, \"If they can do it, why can't I?\", so I went ahead and introduced myself to the community. \nThe best part for newcomers in Layer5 is that not only is each individual warmly welcomed, but that\nLayer5 {\" \"} <a href = \"https://layer5.io/community/meshmates\">MeshMates</a> and Community Managers host a weekly meeting (see the{\" \"}<a href = \"https://layer5.io/community/calendar\">community calendar</a>) dedicated to the success of newcomers, helping each person find a foothold in the community. The overview provided in each weekly Newcomers meeting gives you the leg up that you need to get started with any of{\" \"} <a href = \"https://layer5.io/projects\">Layer5's projects</a> and orients you to the how the community works (the{\" \"} <a href = \"https://layer5.io/community/handbook\">community handbook</a> is an excellent resource in this regard) and who to contact in your areas of interest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I highly recommend all newcomers to engage as much as possible in the community. You will gradually start seeing a change in yourself.\n</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"first-pr\">Way to my First Pull Request 🏁</h3>\n<p>\nI still remember at that time I was just a beginner with Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and most of the issues on the repository were going over my head. \nSo I started with a very beginner-friendly issue about changing a background of a component and who would have thought this changing background issue will eventually change my life in open source. \nThen I made my first ever pull request in Layer5 and that got merged!\n</p>\n<p>\nTry out some good first issues here{\"\"} <a href = \"https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22\">Layer5</a> {\"\"} ,<a href = \"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22\">Meshery</a>💻\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"more-prs\">From 1 Pull Request to 90+ Pull Requests Merged 🚀</h3>\n<p>\n After my first pull request got merged I really got pumped up with joy and told myself that I can do more. This journey of learning and pull requests was not at all easy for me, it took almost 9 months of continuous dedication and effort. There are many great folks I met here in the community, who helped me and taught me new interesting concepts. \n A big thanks to all of them, this was not possible without their guidance and support.\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"learnings-at-Layer5\">Things I learned at Layer5</h2>\n<p>\n   There are a variety of things I learned at Layer5 and a lot I'm learning currently. I gained much technical knowledge as well as soft skills in these 9 months. I spend most of my time working on the UI of Meshery and its various projects. \n   In terms of technical items I learned React, Docker, Kubernetes, new JavaScript concepts, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I would say Layer5 is the best in terms of work ethics, community management, a healthy work environment, and a lot more. \n  You can gain real-life working experience on such big projects and guidance related to your career.\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"learnings-at-Layer5\">How I landed an internship at Layer5?</h2>\n<p>\n  I gradually started learning about the project and made myself choose one area to start with and continued to explore further. I kept pushing myself with patience until I feel strong and capable enough to\n  take responsibilities and give my best to the community, Then I asked and applied for an internship and eventually, I got selected.\n</p>\n<p>Now I can make more impact and grow more under the right guidance.😃</p>\n<h2 id=\"apart-from-coding\">Apart from coding</h2>\n<p>\n  Besides coding at Layer5, I made many new friends, great experiences, and memories.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At last, I would say, join this amazing community and experience the change in yourself. This will open the doors for opportunities for you. Just be tenacious and push yourself, that's all that I did.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Thank you\n</p>\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My Open Source Journey @Layer5","subtitle":"From Contributor to SWE Intern","date":"January 14th, 2022","author":"Gaurav Chadha","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRvAAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSDIAAAABR6CYkSQ4OofDzP4WY3E2IuIv5XgJNQGQMDEoQABDGMYiqzic3hH9n4A5CaP+00akJFZQOCCYAAAAsAQAnQEqFAAUAD7RWKRNKCUjoigNUQAaCWMAyy2MJnC7U+9Q9E5b6XMO9ZlQgAD+1z/pzRrTxe2FqdXqL/cH61jTwYn3kNhdWQA5YLWcimjwOnzhyInI0o8dTEEIHjLH94YG+hwkgwkLIuOXyPQhBcjWT8lN1klbFlAnnTuD5Ql61EvQ+OBRh9lM0eCW2F831IpGAun1FAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/5bc28/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/4f03f/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 750w,\n/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/4f506/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 1080w,\n/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/5bc28/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 1216w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/Gaurav Chadha - Layer5 Intern.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRvAAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSDIAAAABR6CYkSQ4OofDzP4WY3E2IuIv5XgJNQGQMDEoQABDGMYiqzic3hH9n4A5CaP+00akJFZQOCCYAAAAsAQAnQEqFAAUAD7RWKRNKCUjoigNUQAaCWMAyy2MJnC7U+9Q9E5b6XMO9ZlQgAD+1z/pzRrTxe2FqdXqL/cH61jTwYn3kNhdWQA5YLWcimjwOnzhyInI0o8dTEEIHjLH94YG+hwkgwkLIuOXyPQhBcjWT8lN1klbFlAnnTuD5Ql61EvQ+OBRh9lM0eCW2F831IpGAun1FAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/5f169/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/d66e1/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 125w,\n/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/e7160/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 250w,\n/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/5f169/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 500w,\n/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/3cd29/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/Gaurav Chadha - Layer5 Intern.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/my-open-source-journey-layer5"}},{"id":"41e991fb-eaeb-55d4-be96-3a0e20e3329f","body":"\n\n\nimport gsocLogo from \"./gsoc.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n<img src={gsocLogo} className=\"gsoc-image\" align=\"right\" alt=\"gsoc-image\" />\n<p>\n  Hi, I am Piyush Singariya, a short description of me would be “another\n  software engineer watching anime”, in the longer version I am a 2021 graduate\n  from IIT Roorkee, who loves to watch anime and play video games all day.
