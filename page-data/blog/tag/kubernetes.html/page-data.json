This allows you to control and restrict permissions for various resources. In this blog post, we will explore the process of binding a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole. We will also discuss how Meshery, a service mesh management tool, can be utilized to streamline the lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters using MeshMap visual diagrams.</p>\n\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2> \n\n<p>Before we delve into the details, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Access to a running Kubernetes cluster.</li> \n  <li><code>kubectl</code>, the Kubernetes command-line tool, installed and configured to communicate with your cluster.</li>\n  <li>Meshery, the cloud native manager, installed and <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">set up</a> on your local machine.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Binding a Kubernetes Service Account with ClusterRole:</h2>\n\n<p>To bind a Service Account with a ClusterRole, follow the steps outlined below:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Service Account</strong></p>\n<p>First, we need to create a Service Account that we will later bind to a ClusterRole. Use the following kubectl command to create a Service Account named <code>my-service-account</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sh kubectl create serviceaccount my-service-account</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Step 2: Create a ClusterRole</strong></p>\n<p>Next, let's create a ClusterRole that defines the desired permissions. You can either create a new ClusterRole or use an existing one. For the purpose of this example, we will create a ClusterRole named <code>my-cluster-role</code> that has read-only access to Pods and Services:</p>\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRole\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster-role\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\"]\n  resources: [\"pods\", \"services\"]\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"]\n```\n<br />\n<p>Save the above YAML definition to a file named <code>clusterrole.yaml</code>, and create the ClusterRole using the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bash kubectl apply -f clusterrole.yaml</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Step 3: Bind the Service Account with ClusterRole</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, we need to bind the Service Account <code>my-service-account</code> with the ClusterRole <code>my-cluster-role</code>. This can be achieved by creating a ClusterRoleBinding. Execute the following command to create the binding:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bash kubectl create clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding --clusterrole=my-cluster-role --serviceaccount=default:my-service-account</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p>The above command creates a ClusterRoleBinding named <code>my-cluster-role-binding</code> that associates the Service Account <code>my-service-account</code> with the ClusterRole <code>my-cluster-role</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Verification:</strong></p>\n<p>To verify the successful binding, you can use the following command to check the ClusterRoleBinding:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bash kubectl describe clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p>You should see the Service Account and ClusterRole information listed under the <code>Subjects</code> and <code>RoleRef</code> sections, respectively.</p>\n\n<h2>Using Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes Cluster Lifecycle Management:</h2>\n<p>Meshery is a powerful service mesh management tool that simplifies the management and operation of service meshes, including <a href=\"https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kubernetes clusters</a>. MeshMap, a visual diagram feature of Meshery, provides a graphical representation of the service mesh components and their interactions.</p>\n\n<p>To utilize Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management, follow these steps:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Install Meshery</strong></p>\n<p>Refer to the official Meshery <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">documentation</a> to install Meshery on your local machine or within your Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Connect to Your Kubernetes Cluster</strong></p>\n<p>Once Meshery is installed, connect it to your Kubernetes cluster by configuring the necessary authentication and connection details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Access MeshMap</strong></p>\n<p>After successfully connecting Meshery to your Kubernetes cluster, you can access MeshMap from the <a href = \"https://playground.meshery.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meshery</a> user interface. MeshMap visually represents the deployed service mesh, including service endpoints, traffic flows, and workload distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Visualize the Kubernetes Cluster with MeshMap</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have accessed Meshery and connected it to your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps to visualize the cluster using MeshMap:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>From the Meshery user interface, navigate to the MeshMap section.</li>\n  <li>Select your connected Kubernetes cluster from the dropdown menu.</li>\n  <li>Click on the \"Generate Map\" button to generate a visual representation of the service mesh components and their interactions within the cluster.</li>\n  <li>Explore the generated MeshMap to gain insights into your Kubernetes cluster's architecture, traffic patterns, and workload distribution.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In this blog post, we have learned how to bind a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole to control access and authorization within a cluster. We have also explored how Meshery and its MeshMap feature can be used for visualizing the service mesh components and their interactions within a Kubernetes cluster. By following these steps, you can effectively manage and monitor your Kubernetes cluster's lifecycle using RBAC and visualization tools.</p>\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"How To Bind Kubernetes Service Account with ClusterRole","subtitle":"A Comprehensive Guide","date":"June 30th, 2023","author":"Layer5 Team","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/bb8ee/blog-post.png","srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/0dee1/blog-post.png 750w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/8beaa/blog-post.png 1080w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/bb8ee/blog-post.png 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/a66aa/blog-post.webp 750w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/65dd5/blog-post.webp 1080w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/edb28/blog-post.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}},"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/blog-post.png"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/86bab/blog-post.png","srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/e1b03/blog-post.png 125w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/81b70/blog-post.png 250w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/86bab/blog-post.png 500w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/8cf60/blog-post.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/46142/blog-post.webp 125w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/81c3e/blog-post.webp 250w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/cd07d/blog-post.webp 500w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/bf95e/blog-post.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"}]},"width":500,"height":281}},"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/blog-post.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/how-to-bind-kubernetes-service-account-with-clusterrole"}},{"id":"537177cb-afbd-5dc7-90e2-2c71c9eabf6b","body":"\n\n\n\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nKubernetes provides a Service to offer a unified traffic endpoint for the Pods. While it offers a VIP to the clients for access and Kubernetes ensures traffic balancing for the accessing back-end Pods, it has a limitation of routing traffic from outside the cluster. To overcome this issue, a new feature called \"NodePort\" has been introduced. \n\nBy setting up a mapping to a specific port of all nodes in the cluster, a NodePort Service redirects traffic from the outside to the inside of the cluster. When a NodePort Service is created, Kubernetes control plane allocates its corresponding ports in two ways. The first is dynamic, where Kubernetes control plane automatically assigns an unused port at the creation time. The second is static, which assigns a port within the nodeport port range configuration. It is crucial to assign a unique nodePort across the entire cluster while manually assigning nodePort, or it will result in an error if a service of type NodePort already uses that port. \n\nSometimes, there is a need to run a NodePort Service on well-known ports so that other components and users inside or outside the cluster can use them. In such cases, users need to reserve the required ports before using them. Kubernetes 1.27 introduced a new feature gate \"ServiceNodePortStaticSubrange\" that allows users to use a different port allocation strategy for type NodePort Services. Enabling this feature gate will divide the port range for NodePort Services based on a formula that uses nodeport size and determines the size of the static port range.\n\nHere are a few examples of different port ranges and their band offset values:\n<div className=\"table-3\">\n\n| Range properties | Values |\n| --- | --- |\n| service-node-port-range | 30000-32767 |\n| Band Offset | 86 |\n| Static band start | 30000 |\n| Static band end | 30085 |\n| Dynamic band start | 30086 |\n| Dynamic band end | 32767 |\n\n</div>\n<br />\n<div className=\"table-3\">\n\n| Range properties | Values |\n| --- | --- |\n| service-node-port-range | 30000-30015 |\n| Band Offset | 16 |\n| Static band start | 30000 |\n| Static band end | 30015 |\n| Dynamic band start | N/A |\n| Dynamic band end | N/A |\n\n</div>\n\nNodePort Services can be useful in many scenarios. For example, consider a user that needs to expose a Minio object storage service on Kubernetes to clients running outside the Kubernetes cluster. The agreed port is 30009, and the user needs to create a Service as follows:\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: minio\nspec:\n  ports:\n  - name: api\n    nodePort: 30009\n    port: 9000\n    protocol: TCP\n    targetPort: 9000\n  selector:\n    app: minio\n  type: NodePort\n```\nIf the port required for the Minio Service is not reserved and another NodePort (or possibly LoadBalancer) Service is created and dynamically allocated before or concurrently with the Minio Service, the TCP port 30009 might be allocated to that other Service. In this case, creation of the Minio Service will fail due to a node port collision. \n\nIn conclusion, using the NodePort Service will help Kubernetes users by allowing traffic to be routed from outside to inside the cluster, providing a unified traffic endpoint for the Pods. By enabling the ServiceNodePortStaticSubrange feature gate, users can adopt a different port allocation strategy, reducing the risk of collisions while using a different range of ports.\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Kubernetes NodePorts - Static and Dynamic Assignments","subtitle":"Avoiding Port Collisions","date":"May 12th, 2023","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRr4AAABXRUJQVlA4ILIAAABQBACdASoUABQAPtFcpU6oJSMiKAqpABoJagCdAA7o/xI+daMhu4ZyKIc8AP5sMkrm/KSMElhNhyFx1gsn7iAKtDbnb2EOpN1Lu4ERxHR8dZzo2nLfaBjTkL7HUoWJ2ZeN3kbroyt5qSiHJrjn1s8R/0YvwxgPzzQOJ6Z6/jny3fK+Q/p/RG8WRYpz7F7kTd49j//OPWbkB/vQwHCyP2a8pf47eyzW5wuh8SG+Fee1AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/c1587/k8s-nodeports.webp","srcSet":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/4f03f/k8s-nodeports.webp 750w,\n/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/c1587/k8s-nodeports.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/k8s-nodeports.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRr4AAABXRUJQVlA4ILIAAABQBACdASoUABQAPtFcpU6oJSMiKAqpABoJagCdAA7o/xI+daMhu4ZyKIc8AP5sMkrm/KSMElhNhyFx1gsn7iAKtDbnb2EOpN1Lu4ERxHR8dZzo2nLfaBjTkL7HUoWJ2ZeN3kbroyt5qSiHJrjn1s8R/0YvwxgPzzQOJ6Z6/jny3fK+Q/p/RG8WRYpz7F7kTd49j//OPWbkB/vQwHCyP2a8pf47eyzW5wuh8SG+Fee1AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/5f169/k8s-nodeports.webp","srcSet":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/d66e1/k8s-nodeports.webp 125w,\n/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/e7160/k8s-nodeports.webp 250w,\n/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/5f169/k8s-nodeports.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/k8s-nodeports.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-nodeports-static-and-dynamic-assignments"}},{"id":"6a0f849a-8fcf-586a-9cf3-0beaac085455","body":"\n\n\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n<p>\nAs the final Kubernetes release of 2022, Kubernetes 1.26 is an exciting new release of the popular container orchestration platform. It offers a number of new features and improvements that will help platform engineers and DevOps engineers manage their Kubernetes clusters more effectively. Here are some of the highlights of this release. \n</p>\n<div className=\"intro\">\n  <p>\n    As a longstanding CNCF member, Layer5 has donated two of its open source projects to the CNCF: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> and <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">Service Mesh Performance</Link>. As an end-to-end, open-source, multi-cluster Kuberentes management platform, Meshery makes Day 2 Kubernetes cluster management a breeze. Run Meshery to explore the behavorial changes of this Kubernetes release and what they really mean to you. \n  </p>\n</div>\n\nWhile there are a number of enhancments tracked in this release (38), you need to be aware that there are also a number of features being deprecated (10) in 1.26. In this article, we will focus on some highlighted enhancements, important deprecations, and removals so that you can be confident before upgrading your clusters. \n\nWe'll breakdown new K8s features by category, starting with networking.\n\n## Networking in Kubernetes 1.26\n\n### [Service Internal Traffic Policy](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2086) [Stable]\n\nWhen requests are made to a Kubernetes service, they are randomly distributed to all available endpoints. The new enhancement enriches the API of a service to use node-local and topology-aware routing for internal traffic. The new internalTrafficPolicy field has two options: Cluster (default) and Local. The Cluster option works like before and tries distributing requests to all available endpoints. On the other hand, the Local option only sends requests to node-local endpoints and drops the request if there is no available instance on the same node. The Local option is useful for sending metrics or logs to an agent running as a DaemonSet. \n\n### [Reserve Service IP Ranges for Dynamic and Static IP Allocation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3070) [Stable]\n\nKubernetes services are assigned a virtual ClusterIP to be reachable inside the cluster. The ClusterIP is either assigned dynamically from a configured Service IP range, or statically set while creating the service resource. There was no possibility of knowing whether another service in the cluster had already used the static ClusterIP before this new stable enhancement. With this change, the IP range is divided into two; this prevents conflicts between services implementing dynamic IP allocation and static IP assignment. The flag --service-cluster-ip-range, with CIDR notation, is part of the Kubernetes API server configuration and is ready to use with the 1.26 release. \n\n### [Support of Mixed Protocols in Services with Type LoadBalancer](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1435) [Stable]\n\nKubernetes Services that use the LoadBalancer type have only supported a single Layer 4 protocol until now. With this enhancement going from graduating to stable in v1.26, it is possible to define a mix of protocols in the same service definition. In other words, this enhancement allows a LoadBalancer Service to serve different protocols (e.g. UDP, TCP) under the same port (e.g. 443). For example, serving both UDP and TCP requests for a DNS or SIP server on the same port. For instance, you can expose a DNS server with a single load balancer IP for both TCP and UDP requests, such as the following:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: multi-protocol-dns-server\nspec:\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  ports:\n    - name: dns-udp\n      port: 53\n      protocol: UDP\n    - name: dns-tcp\n      port: 53\n      protocol: TCP\n  selector:\n    app: dns-server\n```\n\n## Security in Kubernetes 1.26\n\n### [kubelet Credential Provider](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2133) [Stable]\n\nThe kubelet agent has a built-in credential provider mechanism to retrieve credentials for container image registries. It natively supports Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS container image registries for dynamically retrieving their credentials. The new stable enhancement in v1.26 offers a replacement for the in-tree implementations, and creates an API for extensible plugins in the future. \n\n### [SignedSigning Release Artifacts](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3031) [Beta]\n\nEvery Kubernetes release produces a set of artifacts such as binaries, container images, documentation, and metadata. Since the 1.24 release, the artifacts have been signed as an alpha feature. In the 1.26 release, artifact signing graduates to beta to increase software supply chain security for the Kubernetes release process and mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n### [Reduction of Secret-Based Service Account Tokens](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2799) [Beta]\n\n`BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume` has been GA since version 1.22: Service account tokens for pods are obtained via the TokenRequest API and stored as a projected volume. The new enhancement, in beta, eliminates the need to auto-generate secret-based service account tokens. In addition, Kubernetes will warn about using auto-created secret-based service account tokens, and purge the unused ones.\n\n### [Windows Privileged Containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1981) [Stable] and [Host Networking](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3503) [Alpha] \n\nPrivileged containers are the ones that have similar access and capabilities to the host processes running on the servers. In Linux environments, they are used heavily in Kubernetes for storage, networking, and management. In this release, support for privileged containers for the Windows environment graduates to stable. Management of processes is heavily different from the operating system standpoint in Linux and Windows. Therefore, privileged containers will also work differently in two environments, but they will ensure the same level of security and operational experience.\n\nIn addition, there is a new alpha-level enhancement in this release to support host networking for Windows pods. Currently, Windows has all the functionality to make containers use the networking namespace of the nodes. The new alpha enhancement enables this functionality from the Kubernetes side, increasing the parity between Linux and Windows containers.\n\n### [Self-User Attribute and Authentication API](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/33250) [Alpha] \n\nKubernetes has no resources to identify and manage users as part of its API. Instead, it uses authenticators to get user attributes from tokens, certificates, OIDC providers, or webhooks. The new alpha feature adds a new API endpoint to see what attributes the current users have. The new API is under authentication.k8s.io with the name SelfSubjectReview, and there is a new corresponding command as well: kubectl auth who-am-i. The new feature will reduce the obscurity of complex authentication and help users debug the authentication stack. \n\n## Scheduling in Kubernetes 1.26\n\n### [Non-Graceful Node Shutdown for StatefulSet Pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2268) [Beta]\n\nAs a platform Kubernetes is hardened and has been deploy by thousands and thousands of users. Hardening of Kubernetes makes itself resistant to disasters. The kubelet agent that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster already uses graceful node shutdown to detect and offboard workloads to other nodes. However, when the shutdown is not detected by the kubelet, the pods of a `StatefulSet` are stuck as `Terminating` and not transferred to a healthy node. The kubelet on the downed node will not delete its pods from Kubernetes API, and the StatefulSet controller will not create new pods with the same name. This happens due to a conflict in the Kubernetes machinery. With this enhancement moving into beta, though, pods will be forcefully deleted along with their volume attachments and new pods will be migrated (created) on healthy nodes.\n\n### [Pod Scheduling Readiness](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3521) [Alpha]\n\nCurrently, pods are considered ready for scheduling as soon as they are created. However, not every pod requires a node, resource allocation, and the start of all its containers immediately after its creation. The new alpha enhancement adds an API to mark pods with their scheduling status: paused and ready. Pods with the .spec.schedulingGates field will be parked in the scheduler and only be assigned to nodes when they are ready to be scheduled.\n\n### [kubectl explain to use OpenAPI v3 for ](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3515) [Alpha]\n\nUse of OpenAPI v3 means supporting rich type information in `kubectl explan`. Kubernetes has supported OpenAPI v3 as a beta since version 1.24. This richer representation of the fields in the Kubernetes API, means that users can use the `kubectl explain` command to get information that is only detailed in  OpenAPI v3, and not the subset defined OpenAPI v2.\n\n## Deprecations and Removals\n\nConsistent to the Kubernetes API lifecycle is deprecations and removals of APIs in each release. It is strongly suggested to check whether you are using the following APIs and flags before there are breaking changes.\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Removal of the `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta1` API group for `FlowSchema` and `PriorityLevelConfiguration` requires a migration to the v1beta2 API version.\n</li>\n<li>\n  Removal of the `autoscaling/v2beta2` API version for HorizontalPodAutoscaler requires a migration to the autoscaling/v2 API version. \n</li>\n<li>\n  Removal of legacy and vendor-specific authentication client-go and kubectl for Azure and Google Cloud requires migration to vendor-neutral authentication plugin mechanisms.\n</li>\n<li>\n  Removal of in-tree CSI integration for OpenStack—namely, the `cinder` volume type—requires a migration to use the CSI driver for OpenStack. \n</li>\n<li>\n  Some unused options and flags for the kubectl run command are marked as deprecated in the 1.26 release, such as `--grace-period`, `--timeout`, and `--wait`.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n## Last Kubernetes release of 2022\n\nKubernetes is an ever-evolving platform. For those of you running workloads on Kubernetes taking detailed note of API changes and enhancements is an important activity as you endevour to keep your clusters upgraded with release releases. A more secure, scalable, and flexible Kubernetes is our collective goal. Dign into more details about deprecation, removals, and the latest changes in the 1.26 [release notes](https://relnotes.k8s.io/).\n\nOn behalf of the Layer5 community and all of the CNCF projects that its contributors steward, thank you to everyone who participated in this Kubernetes release, and congratulations! \n\nAs an end-to-end, open-source, multi-cluster Kuberentes management platform, Meshery makes Day 2 Kubernetes cluster management a breeze. Run Meshery to explore the behavorial changes of this Kubernetes release and what they really mean to you. \n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Kubernetes 1.26 Highlights, Features, and Deprecations","subtitle":null,"date":"December 6th, 2022","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpwAAABXRUJQVlA4IJAAAABQBACdASoUABQAPtFgqE+oJSOiKAgBABoJbADBzYrIcLaTwo9+PMnGQagAAP72Av+XnXpDovXZeeq4tTUzLytHh8EOuq1sofHN2IthfXcoC9jFvtZhVo+tDrkfaFYPTkFWBWNyondfXcOX/mOVgrxqRCV7kvjREw4wZJCrfL9qeXzh9e/A/AD1++Ek5WwAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0cda4651daf491c6b40dd404799ca32c/3987a/kubernetes-new.webp","srcSet":"/static/0cda4651daf491c6b40dd404799ca32c/4f03f/kubernetes-new.webp 750w,\n/static/0cda4651daf491c6b40dd404799ca32c/3987a/kubernetes-new.webp 900w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/0cda4651daf491c6b40dd404799ca32c/kubernetes-new.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4fe429ff2237fa91df4168525bb25419/5f169/kubernetes-new-dark.webp","srcSet":"/static/4fe429ff2237fa91df4168525bb25419/d66e1/kubernetes-new-dark.webp 125w,\n/static/4fe429ff2237fa91df4168525bb25419/e7160/kubernetes-new-dark.webp 250w,\n/static/4fe429ff2237fa91df4168525bb25419/5f169/kubernetes-new-dark.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4fe429ff2237fa91df4168525bb25419/kubernetes-new-dark.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-126-highlights-features-and-deprecations"}},{"id":"ee4ff46e-ae65-555e-835d-ca9902fd8876","body":"\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<p>As a platform for developers and system administrators to easily deploy and manage applications in a distributed environment, Kubernetes clusters generate logs and lots of them. One of the key components of Kubernetes is its logging and instrumentation capabilities. The upcoming Kubernetes 1.26 release has a handful of noteworthy changes to its system component logger, <code>klog</code>.</p>\n\n## Kubernetes System Log\n\nSystem component logs record events happening in K8s clusters. More than metrics or traces, logs are the telemetric signal often found to be most useful for debugging. You can configure K8s log verbosity to see more or less detail. Logs can be as coarse-grained as showing errors within a component, or as fine-grained as showing step-by-step traces of events (like HTTP access logs, pod state changes, controller actions, or scheduler decisions).\n\n## Klog\n\n[klog](https://github.com/kubernetes/klog) is a Kubernetes logging library that provides an API for developers and system administrators to instrument their applications for logging and tracing. klog generates log messages for the Kubernetes system components. It provides a comprehensive set of features, including log levels, structured logging and logging context.\n\nKubernetes 1.23 introduced structured logging (in beta) in `klog`. Structured logging is a uniform structure in log messages allowing for programmatic extraction of information. Structured logs can be stored and processed with less effort and cost. The code which generates a log message determines whether it uses the traditional unstructured `klog` output or structured logging.\n\nAs a dependency to structured logging (gated behind `StructuredLogging` feature gate), Kubernetes 1.24 introducted contextual logging (in alpha) in `klog`. Contextual logging builds on top of structured logging. It is primarily about how developers use logging calls: code based on that concept is more flexible and supports additional use cases which will be the topic of a future blog post. \n\n### Klog Deprecations in Kubernetes 1.26\n\nKubernetes has recently announced that it intends to deprecate certain flags related to Klog in its components. This means that Klog-specific flags, such as `--klog-verbosity`, `--klog-vmodule` and `--klog-stderrthreshold` will no longer be supported. This is due to the fact that Klog has been largely superseded by the more comprehensive OpenTelemetry project, which provides a more complete solution for logging and instrumentation.\n\nThe deprecation of Klog-specific flags is a positive step forward for Kubernetes as it moves to OpenTelemetry. This move will ensure that Kubernetes is using the industry-standard logging and instrumentation solution. It will also provide developers and system administrators with a more comprehensive, reliable and consistent experience when instrumenting their applications.\nA goal of this deprecation is one of unblocking development of alternative logging formats. Why does Kubnernetes need another logging format? One reason is performance. Klog performance is much worse than alternatives, for example 7-8x than JSON format:\n\n|logger                 |time [ns/op]|bytes[B/op]|allocations[alloc/op]|\n|-----------------------|------------|-----------|---------------------|\n|Text Infof             |2252        |248        |3                    |\n|Text InfoS             |2455        |280        |3                    |\n|JSON Infof             |1406        |19         |1                    |\n|JSON InfoS             |319         |67         |1                    |\n\nProof of concept implementation of new logging formats were completed to assess the potentional gains of using an alternative format. Results measured on 30s benchmark for passing 2 arguments to format function.\n\n<div className=\"tip\">\n<h3>Tip: Logger Performance Comparison</h3>\n\nInterestingly, Klog isn't the fastest logger in the West, but Uber's open source project [zap ](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) appears to hold that title instead. The following performance test benchmark is an examle of one of a number of scenarios in which loggers can be performance analyzed.\n\n<p>Log a message and 10 fields:</p>\n\n| Package             |    Time     | Time % to zap | Objects Allocated |\n| :------------------ | :---------: | :-----------: | :---------------: |\n| zap                 | 2900 ns/op  |      +0%      |    5 allocs/op    |\n| zap (sugared)       | 3475 ns/op  |     +20%      |   10 allocs/op    |\n| zerolog             | 10639 ns/op |     +267%     |   32 allocs/op    |\n| go-kit              | 14434 ns/op |     +398%     |   59 allocs/op    |\n| logrus              | 17104 ns/op |     +490%     |   81 allocs/op    |\n| apex/log            | 32424 ns/op |    +1018%     |   66 allocs/op    |\n| log15               | 33579 ns/op |    +1058%     |   76 allocs/op    |\n\n</div>\n\nOutput will always be written to stderr, regardless of the output format. Output redirection is expected to be handled by the component which invokes a Kubernetes component. This can be a POSIX shell or a tool like systemd.\n\nThe deprecation of Klog-specific flags is part of a larger effort to transition Kubernetes to a more modern and comprehensive logging and instrumentation solution. This will provide Kubernetes users with a more reliable, secure and consistent experience when instrumenting and monitoring their applications.\n\nKubernetes will continue to provide support for Klog-specific flags for the foreseeable future. However, it is recommended that developers and system administrators begin transitioning their applications to the OpenTelemetry framework. This will ensure that their applications are using the industry-standard solution for logging and instrumentation.\n\nOverall, the deprecation of Klog-specific flags is a positive step forward for Kubernetes. It will ensure that Kubernetes users have access to the most reliable and comprehensive solution for logging and instrumentation. It will also help ensure that Kubernetes is using the industry-standard solution and will provide developers and system administrators with a more reliable and consistent experience when instrumenting their applications.\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Structured logging in Kubernetes with Klog","subtitle":"Deprecating Klog flags in Kubernetes 1.26","date":"December 5th, 2022","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRo4AAABXRUJQVlA4IIIAAAAQBACdASoUABQAPtFYpUyoJSOiKA1RABoJbADE2A9oOHBqhtd/PoCpgAD+9hPef0TEKVio6tt3FOets66Z3rYkj6VKa9nnk5BswW619qW3HimtX50rDTgg73noredVBvmuHNfM92EZ3yl/IPFRzvtyYwEvFfOxgqRkERYrQM26gAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a125a7ad56dafd70886f09d8c408e114/3987a/kubernetes-logs.webp","srcSet":"/static/a125a7ad56dafd70886f09d8c408e114/4f03f/kubernetes-logs.webp 750w,\n/static/a125a7ad56dafd70886f09d8c408e114/3987a/kubernetes-logs.webp 900w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a125a7ad56dafd70886f09d8c408e114/kubernetes-logs.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmwBAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSLYAAAABgGNtm6rmnxncSt2Hyy7cNkClrbvuACqnooV4d0uquKfkUMYNnbknWUFETAD8a+TMU1M6mqgpleqTSb1Uqs7SJDlQXt/eXitBWGQyzyeTuZkHMiw4bmHgAST89BQmTMZCNlOoVguZhIihvDxdnhzNxr9LFQ2Vl51lu9UePvPgjo8PZqMvFnA0qWkpgziNdxKBmEGSg21y+fnu4iX8+Y0QmrhGMMZY/B0hQMeh8k4fAVaEdyL4S1ZQOCCQAAAA8AMAnQEqFAAUAD7RWqNNKCUjIigNUQAaCWwAvkgQ3sibXv8o78YB8AD+6/YtrSM9Rc5Lz22/yXt8aymW8E1+TIYMBxpYCXm0QnmjTq/+uaLWqy+vQVQ7N8FLsC99nCFhoHFMXPczNJAr19SR9ikZu45mfBuGjhMpGfqKbpZZoFUGz46t/rzj/oRetDiwAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/36fd87e316aac4b3df8f3b1a24a3ffeb/5f169/kubernetes-logs-dark.webp","srcSet":"/static/36fd87e316aac4b3df8f3b1a24a3ffeb/d66e1/kubernetes-logs-dark.webp 125w,\n/static/36fd87e316aac4b3df8f3b1a24a3ffeb/e7160/kubernetes-logs-dark.webp 250w,\n/static/36fd87e316aac4b3df8f3b1a24a3ffeb/5f169/kubernetes-logs-dark.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/36fd87e316aac4b3df8f3b1a24a3ffeb/kubernetes-logs-dark.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/kubernetes/structured-logging-in-kubernetes-with-klog"}},{"id":"fbda537a-afd2-57b2-b44d-784c1df43d3c","body":"\n\nimport Switcher from \"./context-switcher.webp\";\nimport Deploy from \"./deploy-modal.webp\";\nimport Cluster2 from \"./meshmap-cluster2.webp\";\nimport Cluster1 from \"./meshmap-cluster1.webp\";\nimport Settings from \"./settings.webp\";\nimport Cluster from \"./cluster-mgmt.webp\";\nimport Flush from \"./flush-meshsync.webp\";\nimport CoreArch from \"./meshery-core-architecture.webp\";\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n  <p>\n    From multi-mesh to now multi-cluster, <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> is\n    continuously expanding its capability to give developers, operators, and\n    security engineers more control over their infrastructure. In this post,\n    we'll take a look behind the scenes at how each component in Meshery's\n    architecture plays a role in the management of many Kubernetes clusters.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n## Philosophy behind Meshery's multi-cluster management approach\n\nWhile designing Meshery for the world of many service meshes, and many Kubernetes clusters, much care has been taken to ensure that Meshery is an <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility\">extensible management platform</a>, ready for handling new types of infrastructure and new use cases rapidly through its plugin model. Under the hood, <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\">Meshery Server</a> acts as a delegator of operations by figuring out which Meshery Adapter registered its capability against the given operation. The operation is then sent to that given component (like one of Meshery’s service mesh adapters,e.g. Istio adapter) via a gRPC call. <img src={CoreArch} alt=\"deploy modal\"  className=\"image-right\" /> When the operation involves a Kubernetes cluster(s), the kubeconfig(s) is sent as a parameter to the RPCs. It is then the job of the handling adapter to respect that and perform the operation across the passed clusters from kubeconfigs as needed. The operations not requiring a kubeconfig are managed through the same RPC, with the only difference being that the handling component would ignore the `kubeconfigs` field altogether making the system work not just for Kubernetes, but for other cloud native use cases. This approach of reusing the same RPC for different types of requests is pretty common and sometimes debatable with the other approach of being strict with the RPCs. This is what makes Meshery completely pluggable and extensible.\n\n## Using multi cluster with Meshery\n\nFrom a client's perspective, there are two uses of the multi context feature in general. While deploying a <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> design or performing any other operation on their cluster(s), selecting any number of Kubernetes contexts will allow them to uniformly and parallely perform the operation across the clusters. And while visualizing the state of their cluster(s), the same context switcher will allow them to filter across the clusters whose view they want to see.\n\nAll cluster specific operations are now applied over a number of clusters uniformly. So if you have 10 clusters to manage and 8 of those start with the exact same set of pods, deployments, service mesh, etc then <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> can help you to apply these operations quickly and easily.\n\nIt is as simple as selecting the specific cluster(s) from the Kubernetes context switcher in the navbar, and then applying whatever operation you wanted to, whether that be deploying a sample app, a service mesh, or a <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> design.\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img src={Switcher} alt=\"context switcher\" className=\"image-center-shadow\" />\n</p>\n\nJust before applying the operation, you will be prompted with a confirmation modal which will provide the information about which cluster(s) that operation will be performed against. As the User interface improves, this same modal will also convey more useful information about the operation they are going to perform.\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img src={Deploy} alt=\"deploy modal\" className=\"image-center-shadow\" />\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n### Using MeshMap visualizer\n\nYou can switch between views of your cluster in visualizer mode while using <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link>.\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img\n    src={Cluster2}\n    alt=\"visualizer showing data of context1\"\n    className=\"slides-right\"\n  />\n</p>\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img\n    src={Cluster1}\n    alt=\"visualizer showing data of context2\"\n    className=\"slides-left\"\n  />\n</p>\n\n### Managing Meshery on multiple clusters\n\nUsers can perform cluster related operations from the settings page like adding more clusters, removing data from existing clusters and removing existing clusters.\n\n<img src={Settings} alt=\"Settings page\" className=\"slides-right\" />\n\nMeshery also deploys Meshery operator across the cluster it’s about to manage. This operator manages the lifecycle of a Meshery broker and MeshSync. MeshSync pumps the blood into Meshery’s core, in other words, it is responsible for watching all different types of resources by establishing a watch stream over each of them. MeshSync then pumps that data into the NATS server, of which Meshery server itself is a client. From there, Meshery server gets all the relevant data related to activities in the cluster.\n\nBy default, <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> wants to be as much aware about your infrastructure as possible to provide value so it deploys its operator across each detected cluster. But you can fine tune this configuration by going over each one of them from the table as shown.\n\n<img\n  src={Cluster}\n  alt=\"Kubernetes multi-cluster management with Meshery\"\n  className=\"image-center-shadow\"\n/>\n\nIf you disconnect your cluster and do not want to persist the data from that cluster then you can perform a fine-grained deletion by deleting all MeshSync data (which are the Kubernetes objects) for that specific cluster.\n\n<img src={Flush} alt=\"flushing MeshSync data\" className=\"image-center-shadow\" />\n## Future of multi-cluster\n\nMeshery as an extension point to your infrastructure provides out-of-the-box value by adding components which can be Kubernetes specific, service mesh specific or custom components to add new functionality. We can now add multi-cluster specific components to provide more abstraction. This model can be used along with Meshery’s multi-mesh capabilities to give an overall multi-mesh multi-cluster experience to the user. For instance, your Istio service mesh spanning across multiple clusters can be abstracted and managed by Meshery using custom components such as VirtualGateway and VirtualDestinationRules. In this case, Meshery’s Istio adapter will handle the logic of converting a VirtualGateway into gateways across the clusters. This abstraction provides high value by powering the service mesh to span across the clusters while the Ops team can configure the mesh with minimal effort.\n\nJust like the example above, many such Meshery extension points are in Meshery to add logic into and add useful functionality.

The following command creates  a resource group named MesheryGroup in <code>southindia</code> location. </p>\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">\naz group create --name MesheryGroup --location southindia\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Create AKS cluster using <code>az aks create</code>. The following command creates aks cluster with a single node. </p>\n\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">\naz aks create --resource-group MesheryGroup --name MesheryAKS --node-count 1 --generate-ssh-keys\n</code></pre>\n<p>After a few minutes, the command completes and returns a JSON formatted information about the cluster.</p>\n<p>You can connect with your cluster by using <code>az aks get-credentials</code> ,  which basically downloads credentials and configure the Kubernetes CLI. </p>\n<pre><code>\naz aks get-credentials --resource-group MesheryGroup --name MesheryAKS\n</code></pre>\n<p>Verify the connection to your cluster using the <code>kubectl get command</code>. </p>\n<pre><code>\n$kubectl get nodes\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Install Meshery into your AKS cluster</h3>\n\n```\nhelm repo add meshery https://meshery.io/charts/\n\nhelm install meshery meshery/meshery --namespace meshery --create-namespace\n\n```\n<p>Meshery server supports customizing authentication flow callback URL, which can be configured in the following way.</p>\n\n<pre><code>\nhelm install meshery meshery/meshery --namespace meshery --set env.MESHERY_SERVER_CALLBACK_URL=https://custom-host --create-namespace\n</code></pre>\n<p>Port forward to Meshery UI</p>\n\n```\nexport POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace meshery -l \"app.kubernetes.io/name=meshery,app.kubernetes.io/instance=meshery\" -o jsonpath=\"{.items[0].metadata.name}\")\n\n$ kubectl --namespace meshery port-forward $POD_NAME 9081:8080\n\n```\n<p>Meshery should now be running in your AKS cluster and the Meshery UI should be accessible at the specified endpoint you’ve exposed to. Navigate to the meshery service endpoint to log into Meshery.</p>\n\n<div><img src={mesheryui} className=\"image-center\" alt=\"Meshery UI Dashboard\" /></div>\n\n<p>From here, your Meshery deployment on AKS is ready to use. In order to login to Meshery, authenticate with your chosen provider from the list.</p>\n<p>There are different ways to configure a Meshery on AKS.
