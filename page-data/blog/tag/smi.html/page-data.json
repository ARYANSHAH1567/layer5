Let’s examine what each specification provides.</p>\n\n<img src={smpLogo} className=\"image-left-no-shadow\" alt=\"service mesh performance logo\" /><p><a href=\"https://smp-spec.io\">Service Mesh Performance</a> standardizes service mesh value measurement, characterizing any deployment's performance by capturing the details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration and workload metadata.</p>\n\n<img src={smiLogo} className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"service mesh interface logo\" /><p><a href=\"https://smi-spec.io\">Service Mesh Interface</a> provides a standard interface for service meshes on Kubernetes. These (currently) four specfications offer a common denominator set of interfaces to support most common service mesh use cases and the flexibility to evolve to support new service mesh capabilities over time.</p>\n\n<p>As a service mesh agnostic tool that provides lifecycle and performance management of a large number of (10+) service meshes, Kubernetes applications, service mesh patterns and WebAssembly filters, Meshery is the ideal tool for the job when it comes to implementing these specifications.</p>\n\n<p>Meshery also comes with two new GitHub Actions that do exactly this. The <a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smi-conformance-action\">Meshery SMI Conformance Action</a> which <a href=\"https://meshery.io/blog/validating-smi-conformance-with-meshery\">validates SMI conformance</a> in your pipeline and the <a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action\">Meshery SMP Action</a> which runs <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management\">SMP compatible performance benchmarks</a>.</p>\n<p>But how do we use these actions? What do they offer? Let’s find out!</p>\n\n<h2>Service Mesh Interface Conformance GitHub Action</h2>\n\n<p>Conformance of SMI specifications is defined as a series of test assertions. These test assertions are categorised by SMI specification (of which, there are currently four specifications) and comprise the complete suite of SMI conformance tests. Conformance requirements will change appropriately as each new version of the SMI spec is released. Refer to Meshery's documentation for details of how <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/service-mesh-interface\">Meshery performs SMI conformance</a>.</p>\n\n<img src={githubBlack} className=\"image-left-no-shadow\" style={{maxWidth: \"9vw\"}} />\n\n<h3>Using Meshery's SMI Conformance GitHub Action</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/service-mesh-interface-conformance-with-meshery\">Service Mesh Interface Conformance GitHub Action</a> is available in the GitHub Marketplace. You can configure this action to trigger with each of your releases, on every pull request. or any GitHub workflow trigger event.</p>\n<p>An example of the action configuration which runs on every release is shown below. The action handles setting up a Kubernetes environment, deploying the service mesh (see supported service meshes), running the conformance tests and reporting back the results to the SMI Conformance dashboard in Meshery.</p>\n\n```yaml\nname: SMI Conformance with Meshery\non:\n  push:\n    tags:\n      - 'v*'\n\njobs:\n  smi-conformance:\n    name: SMI Conformance\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n\n      - name: SMI conformance tests\n        uses: layer5io/mesheryctl-smi-conformance-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: ${{ secrets.MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN }}\n          service_mesh: open_service_mesh\n          mesh_deployed: false\n```\n\n<p>You can also bring in their own cluster with specific capabilities and with a service mesh already installed.</p>\n\n```yaml\nname: SMI Conformance with Meshery\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      - 'master'\n\njobs:\n  smi-conformance:\n    name: SMI Conformance tests on master\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n\n      - name: Deploy k8s-minikube\n        uses: manusa/actions-setup-minikube@v2.4.1\n        with:\n          minikube version: 'v1.21.0'\n          kubernetes version: 'v1.20.7'\n          driver: docker\n\n      - name: Install OSM\n        run: |\n           curl -LO https://github.com/openservicemesh/osm/releases/download/v0.9.1/osm-v0.9.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz\n           tar -xzf osm-v0.9.1-linux-amd64.tar.gz\n           mkdir -p ~/osm/bin\n           mv ./linux-amd64/osm ~/osm/bin/osm-bin\n           PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/osm/bin/\"\n           osm-bin install --osm-namespace default\n\n      - name: SMI conformance tests\n        uses: layer5io/mesheryctl-smi-conformance-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: ${{ secrets.MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN }}\n          service_mesh: open_service_mesh\n          mesh_deployed: true\n```\n\n<p>You can download a token from Meshery and add it as a GitHub secret (in the example above, the secret is <code>MESHERY_PROVIDER_TOKEN</code>). After the test is run, you can view the results from the Service Mesh Interface dashboard in Meshery UI.</p>\n\n<p style={{align: \"center\"}}>\n<img src={smidashboard} className=\"image-center-shadow\" style={{width: \"70%\"}} alt=\"smi conformance dashboard\" /> <br />\n<i>Meshery's Service Mesh Interface Conformance Results</i>\n</p>\n\n<p>Participating service mesh projects can also <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/service-mesh-interface#reporting-conformance\">automatically report their conformance test results</a> to the <a href=\"https://meshery.io/service-mesh-interface\">SMI Conformance dashboard</a></p>\n\n<h2>Service Mesh Performance GitHub Action</h2>\n\n<p>Measuring and managing the performance of a service mesh is key to efficient operation of any service mesh. Meshery is the canonical implementation of the Service Mesh Performance specification. You can choose from multiple load generators and use a highly configurable set of load profiles with variable tunable facets to run a performance test. Meshery packages all these features into an easy-to-use GitHub Action.</p>\n\n<img src={githubBlack} className=\"image-left-no-shadow\" style={{maxWidth: \"9vw\"}} />\n\n<h3>Using Meshery's Service Mesh Performance GitHub Action</h3>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/actions/performance-testing-with-meshery\">Service Mesh Performance GitHub Action</a> is available in the GitHub Marketplace.You can create your own performance profiles to run repeatable tests with Meshery. You can configure this action to trigger with each of your releases, on every pull request. or any GitHub workflow trigger event. A sample configuration of the action is shown below.</p>\n\n```yaml\nname: Meshery SMP Action\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n      'master'\n\njobs:\n  performance-test:\n    name: Performance Test\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: checkout\n        uses: actions/checkout@v2\n        with:\n          ref: 'perf'\n\n      - name: Deploy k8s-minikube\n        uses: manusa/actions-setup-minikube@v2.4.1\n        with:\n          minikube version: 'v1.21.0'\n          kubernetes version: 'v1.20.7'\n          driver: docker\n\n      - name: Run Performance Test\n        uses: layer5io/meshery-smp-action@master\n        with:\n          provider_token: ${{ secrets.PROVIDER_TOKEN }}\n          platform: docker\n          profile_name: soak-test\n```\n\n<p>You can also define your test configuration in an SMP compatible configuration file as shown below.</p>\n\n```yaml\nsmp_version: v0.0.1\nid:\nname: Istio Performance Test\nlabels: {}\nclients:\n- internal: false\n  load_generator: fortio\n  protocol: 1\n  connections: 2\n  rps: 10\n  headers: {}\n  cookies: {}\n  body: \"\"\n  content_type: \"\"\n  endpoint_urls:\n  - http://localhost:2323/productpage\nduration: \"30m\"\n```\n\n<p>See this sample GitHub workflow (<a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action/blob/master/action.yml\">action.yml</a>) for more configuration details.</p>\n\n<img src={perfdashboard} className=\"image-center\" alt=\"performance management dashboard\" />\n\n<p>The results from the tests are updated on the Performance Management dashboard in Meshery.

In this talk, he walked through service mesh specifications and why they matter in your deployment.\n   How many service mesh specifications do you know? He went through all of them. So, no worries if you're unfamiliar.\n  </p>\n</div>   \n\n### Service Mesh Specifications:\n<img src={Abstractions} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"abstractions\" />\n\nAs the ubiquity of service meshes unfolds and they become a commonplace for any cloud native or edge environment, so does the need for vendor and technology-agnostic interfaces to interact with them. The Service Mesh Interface (SMI), the Service Mesh Performance (SMP), and Multi-Vendor Service Mesh Interoperation (Hamlet) are three open specifications solving the challenge of interoperability, workload and performance management between service meshes. \n\nLearn what makes each of them unique and why they are much needed. See each of these three specifications in action as we use Meshery, the open-source service mesh management plane to demonstrate the value and functionality of each service mesh abstraction, and the adherence of these specifications by Istio, Linkerd, Consul and other popular service meshes.\n\n### Cloud native Journey to service meshes:\n\n<img src={Journey} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"journey-image\" />\n\nThe advent of cloud native was the popularization of containers. Thank you Docker! From there, containers took off like wildfire. Turns out you need an orchestrator to wrangle that sprawl. We saw a number of orchestrators come and we still have a number of orchestrators around.\n\nService meshes have become a hot topic in the last few years. They still continue to be, rightfully so, a very powerful piece of technology. “A lot of the power is yet to come from my perspective. For my part, I believe that there is a tomorrow in which data plane intelligence really matters. And matters about how people write cloud native applications.”, Lee emphasized. Not everyone quite understands the capabilities of meshes as they are promoted and spoken about today. So come along into the journey of service mesh.\n\nThere are a number of service meshes out there. One of the community projects is to track the landscape of all of the meshes there are. There’s a lot to say about each of them, their architecture, and their working. Why are they made? Who are they focused on? What do they do? When did they come about? Why are some of them not here anymore? Why are we still seeing new ones? A lot of things to go through. You might be interested in any number of the details that the landscape tracks.\n <div className=\"note\">Be Aware, It's Meshy Out There!</div>\n\n### Service Mesh Interface\n<img src={SMI} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"smi-image\" />\n<ul>\n    <li>Its goal and genesis were born inside of Kubernetes.</li>\n    <li> Being a specification that is native to Kubernetes, its focus is on lowest common denominator functionality.</li>\n    <li> The focus on bringing forth APIs that highlight and reinforce the most common use cases that service meshes are being used for currently</li>\n    <li>Leaves space and provides extensibility room for additional APIs to address other service mesh functionality as more people adopt and make use cases well known.</li>\n    <li>There are seven service meshes that claim compatibility with SMI. There's been a community effort, open-source effort to create service mesh conformance tests to assert whether or not a given service mesh is compatible with SMI</li>\n    <li> In order to facilitate those types of tests, you need to have a tool to provision a sample application on those services which will generate load and test whether traffic splitting behaves as expected or works with that service mesh implementation properly.</li>\n    <li>Then you need to be able to collect the results, guarantee the provenance of those results and publish them.</li>\n    <li> As a community, we turned to Meshery as the tool to implement <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI conformance</Link> and we have been working with the individual service meshes to validate their conformance. </li>\n</ul>    \n<b>Meshery</b>\n<ul>\n  <li> We work on an open-source project called <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>.</li>\n  <li> Meshery, the cloud native management plane, is the canonical implementation of the service mesh performance.</li>\n  <li>The management planes can do a number of things to help bridge the divide between other back-end systems and service meshes. They also help performance management, configuration management, making sure you are following best practices in your implementations by taking common patterns and applying them to your environment </li>\n</ul>\nLet's take a moment to demo what it looks like to validate conformance in SMI using Meshery.\n\n<img src={Graph} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"graph\" />\n<ul>\n   <li> We need to spin up Meshery locally</li>\n   <li> We use mesheryctl as the command line interface to work with Meshery.</li>\n   <li> We can interact with a number of different service mesh. The service mesh we’re going to work with today is an Open service mesh (one of those 7 that is compatible with SMI). Let’s put it to the test.</li>\n   <li> We'll initiate <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI conformance</Link></li>\n   <li>These tests go and do assertions across these different specifications. We’re looking at traffic access, traffic splitting, traffic specification. Meshery then collects these results and will eventually be publishing them in combination with the SMI project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n### Service Mesh Performance\n<img src={SMP} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"smp-image\" />\n<ul>\n    <li>Focused on describing and capturing the performance of a service mesh.</li>\n    <li>The overhead of the value is another way of looking at it and characterizing it.</li>\n    <li>Trying to characterize the performance of the infrastructure of a service mesh can be really difficult.</li>\n    <li>Considering the number of variables that you would have to track, how difficult it can be to have repeatable tests, and benchmark your environment, to track your history based on your environment, compare performance between other meshes people need.</li>\n    <li>SMP creates a standard way of capturing the performance of the mesh to help with these issues.</li>\n    <li>It's also the way in which you're configuring your control plan of your service mesh.</li>\n</ul>    \n\nYou might be using a client library to do some service mesh functionality. Maybe you're using those in combination with the service mesh. What costs more? What's more efficient? What's more powerful? Maybe you're using web assembly and filters there.\nThese are all open questions that <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">SMP</Link> assists in answering in your environment. You’d be surprised by some of the results of some tests that we have done and that the community has done in combination with a couple of universities and graduate students.\n\n<b>Performance Test</b>\n\nDemonstration of the implementation of service mesh Performance:\n\n<img src={Flowchart} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"flowchart\" />\n<ul>\n  <li> On the terminal, we have a local deployment of Meshery running. You can also deploy on Kubernetes as well as the vendor Kubernetes platforms like AKS, EKS and GCP or you can use a dockerized container to run Meshery. You can also have your Kubernetes on Docker desktop.</li>\n  <li>We have the Open service mesh deployed.</li>\n  <li> The Meshery UI is exposed at 9081 port. This is the UI which is used to instantiate a Load test.</li>\n  <li> Over here you can see we have 3 load generators fortio, wrk2, nighthawk.</li>\n  <li> All of these load generators have their own set of attributes which they record correctly and each of its attributes have their own significance. We begin with fortio.</li>\n  <img src={Bucket} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"graph\" />\n\n  <li> You can actually download the test results or you can just browse into the Results Tab and see all of the tests which you have run until now.</li>\n  <li>Next, we used nighthawk to generate the load and benchmark the service for the same. Nighthawk is a load generator which is maintained by the Envoy community and is relatively new. It still hasn't got its 1.0 release but right now Nighthawk has sufficient features to compete with different generators which are still in the play. It can generate a gRPC service on its own and it has some more attributes which you can expose using their CLI tools.</li>\n  <li> You can also see that Meshery has the capability to search your environment, see what specifications are being used and what's the load on your Kubernetes.</li>\n  <li>Jump into the results Tab and see how we compare with these results.</li>\n  <li>You can click on the download. You will see that a yaml gets downloaded in which you can browse and see that the start time, load time, the performance latencies, the metrics are being captured.</li>\n</ul>  \n\n### Hamlet or Multi-vendor Service Mesh Interoperation\n<img src={Hamlet} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"hamlet-image\" />\n<ul>\n  <li>Focus on service mesh federation</li>\n  <li>Specifies a set of API standards for enabling service mesh federation</li>\n  <li>Hamlet takes on a client-server architecture in which resources and services of one service mesh are discovered, registered and using a common format, information about them is exchanged between different service mesh.</li>\n  <li>Rules around authentication and authorization rules around which Services get exposed and to whom and who can communicate with them and whether or not they can do it securely. These are things that Hamlet addresses.</li>\n  <li>\n  The specification currently consists of two APIs:\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>The Federated Resource Discovery API</strong>: API to authenticate and securely distribute resources between federated service meshes.</li>\n      <li>The <strong>Federated Service Discovery API</strong>: API to discover, reach, authenticate and securely communicate with federated services.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Part of the real power is the ability to overcome what are likely to be separate administrative domains. The intention here is to marry up connect two disparate service mesh deployments, those deployments might be of the same type, they might be of two different types.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIn addition to SMI, SMP and Hamlet there has been an emergence of service mesh patterns, by which people are running and operating service meshes. There is a service mesh working group under CNCFs network that is helping identify those patterns of which there's a list right now unbeknownst to you. Reach out, join it, help us work through the 60 patterns that are defined right now. 30 of those are going into an <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books\">O’Reilly</Link> book called <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books/service-mesh-patterns\">Service Mesh Patterns</Link>.\n\nSomething that isn’t always obvious to folks is this piece of value that people get from a service mesh and actually from the specifications that we were just mentioning. It is the fact that teams are decoupled when you’re running a mesh. Developers get to iterate a bit independently of operators, and so do operators get to make changes to implement infrastructure to the way that applications behave independent of developers in the presence of a mesh.  Both of these teams are significantly empowered. Everybody gets a piece of power when they deploy a mesh.\n\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite  come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Service Mesh Specifications and Why They Matter","subtitle":null,"date":"September 20th, 2021","author":"Debopriya Bhattacharjee","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoR3N4AAWScxK3A0AAD+y+7TltDm8faWnWkrgNwKEaB+a5F7h6kfv+PNmIbiHtDLJbrKy70mpaSz/NUvAS+UKSii+WgoY4/+Ld6wAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/a66aa/Cover-image.webp 750w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/65dd5/Cover-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/f9724/Cover-image.webp 1366w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5630208333333334}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/Cover-image.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoR3N4AAWScxK3A0AAD+y+7TltDm8faWnWkrgNwKEaB+a5F7h6kfv+PNmIbiHtDLJbrKy70mpaSz/NUvAS+UKSii+WgoY4/+Ld6wAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/cd07d/Cover-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/46142/Cover-image.webp 125w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/81c3e/Cover-image.webp 250w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/cd07d/Cover-image.webp 500w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/bf95e/Cover-image.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":281}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/Cover-image.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/service-mesh-specifications/service-mesh-specifications-and-why-they-matter"}},{"id":"41186fe5-9702-5f79-9115-7013aba6492e","body":"\n\nimport conformance from \"./conformance-results.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nReleased on August 5th, 2020 by Microsoft, [Open Service Mesh](https://openservicemesh.io/) (OSM) is a lightweight and [Service Mesh Interace conformant](https://layer5.io/smi) (SMI). Open Service Mesh is a contemporary addition to the [service mesh landscape](/service-mesh-landscape). Using Envoy as its data plane proxy component and SMI specifications as it's control plane APIs, OSM draws lessons and code from existing service mesh projects, like Linkerd. The Open Service Mesh project has some miles to go as it is one of a growing list of choices available in the service mesh landscape.\n\nFirst pronounced to be SMI compliant by [Meshery](https://meshery.io/), the cloud native management plane, the first release of OSM supports a myriad of basic\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Securing service to service links</li>\n    <li>Supporting traffic shifting</li>\n    <li>Managing observability for your services</li>\n    <li>Validating and Implementing access control policies</li>\n    <li>Auto addition of applications and services</li>\n</ul>\n\n### Get started with OSM using Meshery\nIn Layer5's effort to support our multi-mesh world, our Meshery project provides an effortless way for Kubernetes operators to install, maintain and run service meshes. [Meshery v0.4.3](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/releases/tag/v0.4.3) includes the [Meshery Adapter for Open Service Mesh](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-osm), enabling you to quickly provision OSM, run any number of sample applications, manage its performance using [Service Mesh Performance](https://smp-spec.io/) (SMP), validate OSM's compliance to SMI using a suite of conformance tests. Meshery offers configuraiton management with builtin best practice configuration analysis giving you confidence in applying custom configuration to OSM.

It utilizes CRDs to modify the behavior of service meshes. The project is under development at [SMI Github Repository](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec). Please visit the github repository page to know the latest advancements in the characteristics. The complete spec can be found [here](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md).\n\n### APIs in SMI\n\nCurrently SMI supports 4 set of APIs:\n\n- [Traffic Specs](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-specs) - Used to define traffic, currently only supports TCP, HTTP traffic.\n- [Traffic Access Control](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-access-control) - Used to specify whether a particular form of traffic is allowed or not\n- [Traffic Split](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-split) - Used to redirect/divide a request for a resource between 2 or more resources. Useful in canary testing\n- [Traffic Metrics](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-metrics) - Used to expose common traffic metrics like p99 in a specific format that can be utilized by single dashboard for all the service meshes.\n\n### About SMI Conformance Tests\n\n**SMI Conformance Tests** check whether the service mesh that is installed in the kubernetes cluster, conforms to SMI specs or not. This involves asking some major questions. Does it have the required CRDs? Do these CRDs perform as they should when applied or not applied? Are we able to get metrics in a proper format?\n\nAll these questions will be answered by SMI conformance tests. The biggest benefit of your service mesh conforming to SMI is that it makes building tools an easier process.Also, one time development of any tool would in turn support all the meshes that conform to SMI.\n\nSounds fun, right? Let's dig deeper into the SMI conformance project and find out.\n\n### Meshery'ing with Conformance Tests\n\n<img src={checklist} align=\"left\" alt=\"checklist\" width=\"250px\"/>\n\n<Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>  is _the cloud native management plane__. It supports all the popular meshes, teaches you how to manage them, assists you in applying custom or recommended configurations, tests for  compatibility, performs performance tests for meshes and a lot more. The SMI conformance testing requires performance testing capabilities, load generation (Meshery is about to support distributed load generation as well), and other functionalities such that these conformance tests can be easily used in the pipelines of all the popular service meshes. mesheryctl does have a perf command that can be used in the pipelines of service meshes. I aim at making such capabilities for SMI conformance as well.\n\nAs you have made your way halfway through the post (thank you for your patience), you should now be aware of SMI, its conformance practices and how Meshery’s incredible engineering can be utilized for conformance tests. We can now tackle the larger questions and hope to see the bigger picture.\n\n### The Bigger Picture\n\nDo you know that almost all of the test cases that we would write in this project would be  raw YAML files? To those doing traditional unit and integration tests, we might sound unhinged at this point. We assure you that we are completely sober and serious (if you don’t count the temporary euphoria from geeky jokes).\n\n#### Forking [kuttl](https://kuttl.dev/)\n\n`kuttl` is a tool for writing tests against Kubernetes operators and controllers. It can ascertain whether any kind of resources exist or not in the Kubernetes cluster, spring up a kind cluster and do other convenient things. Another plus is that It's entirely declarative. Consider a scenario in which we have a special use case where we wanted to run some go code  after each individual step in the test case was executed. To accomplish this, we forked `kuttl` and modified it a little. You can see our modified version [here](https://github.com/kanishkarj/kuttl).\n\n\nWe are planning to use `kuttl` for all the APIs in SMI. We are also planning to use the Meshery load generator with the modified version of `kuttl`.\n\n#### [Learn Layer5](https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5/)\n\nLearn Layer5 is a sample app which is very lightweight and simple to deploy. It is a simple sample app for learning about service meshes. We are planning to use the same app for testing for SMI conformance. The app is deployed when we test for SMI conformance and traffic is generated from one service/deployment/pod to another. This is a great tool for playing around with service meshes and the tools provided by Layer5 and its projects without investing any personal resources.\n\nThis is where all the test cases along with the code will be placed. Currently, there is a large overlap in the learn-layer5 and `smi-conformance` testing files. All those changes will be transferred here.\n\nIf any of this sounds remotely exciting, I implore you to give this a chance. You won’t regret it.\nHead over to our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and join the #smi channel where everything related to conformance testing is discussed. We would love to hear your feedback. Stay tuned for more blogs related to SMI Conformance and all things meshy!!!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Starting SMI Conformance Testing with Meshery","subtitle":"","date":"June 25th, 2020","author":"Naveen Kumar","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/d0daea53e35a8641bb6bf51dfd650543/smi-conformance.svg"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/d0daea53e35a8641bb6bf51dfd650543/smi-conformance.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/starting-smi-conformance-testing-with-meshery"}},{"id":"fbc0a4e6-e2df-5139-835a-843d390eaa13","body":"\n\nimport SmiLogo from \"./smi-logo.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img className=\"image-left\" src={SmiLogo} alt=\"SMI Logo\"/>\n\nMost began their cloud native journey with their first step being use of containers, and taking a second step, moved into container orchestration as their workloads grew. Now, waves and waves of organizations are considering service meshes as their third significant step in their cloud native journey. As they invest into service meshes as their next layer of key infrastructure, users will continue to look for the same assurances sought from other commonly accepted (standard) interfaces for container runtimes (e.g. CRI), container storage (e.g. CSI), container networking (e.g. CNI) and they will look for a commonly accepted service mesh interface.\n\nAs a prominent supporter of management software for multiple service meshes, Layer5 is pleased to partner with Microsoft in support of the [Service Mesh Interface](https://smi-spec.io) (SMI). The Service Mesh Interface is a specification for service meshes that run on Kubernetes. As such, SMI defines a common standard that can be implemented by a variety of service mesh projects and vendors.\n\nLike standards before SMI, consistent APIs inspire confidence in infrastructure stability, community-managed APIs assuage technology and vendor lock-in concerns, and steward the resounding of core use cases, resulting in streamlining the smaller, but critical-to-users, subset of capabilities offered across the [service mesh landscape](https://layer5.io/landscape).\n\nMeshery and SMI are aligned on common goals of getting users started quickly, understanding that users want service mesh technology, but have questions as to which service mesh use, how, and when to get started through a common interface. Meshery’s playground capabilities quick provision a variety of service meshes and reduce time to value and time to understanding for those adopting a service mesh.\n\nAs a multi-mesh manager, Meshery, understands that each service mesh has it own strengths. SMI intends to allow for differentiation by service mesh providers, at the same time providing interoperability between service meshes and their surrounding tooling. As a management plane, Meshery enhances networking intelligence in a multi-mesh way, encouraging users to expect more from their infrastructure. Meshery exposes each service mesh’s differentiated capabilities.\n\nSMI’s aim for consistent APIs facilitates Meshery’s same goals, allowing for users and tools to flourish. As SMI unveils today, so does Meshery’s compatibility.
