This allows you to control and restrict permissions for various resources. In this blog post, we will explore the process of binding a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole. We will also discuss how Meshery, a service mesh management tool, can be utilized to streamline the lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters using MeshMap visual diagrams.</p>\n\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2> \n\n<p>Before we delve into the details, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Access to a running Kubernetes cluster.</li> \n  <li><code>kubectl</code>, the Kubernetes command-line tool, installed and configured to communicate with your cluster.</li>\n  <li>Meshery, the cloud native manager, installed and <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">set up</a> on your local machine.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Binding a Kubernetes Service Account with ClusterRole:</h2>\n\n<p>To bind a Service Account with a ClusterRole, follow the steps outlined below:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Service Account</strong></p>\n<p>First, we need to create a Service Account that we will later bind to a ClusterRole. Use the following kubectl command to create a Service Account named <code>my-service-account</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sh kubectl create serviceaccount my-service-account</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Step 2: Create a ClusterRole</strong></p>\n<p>Next, let's create a ClusterRole that defines the desired permissions. You can either create a new ClusterRole or use an existing one. For the purpose of this example, we will create a ClusterRole named <code>my-cluster-role</code> that has read-only access to Pods and Services:</p>\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRole\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster-role\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\"]\n  resources: [\"pods\", \"services\"]\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"]\n```\n<br />\n<p>Save the above YAML definition to a file named <code>clusterrole.yaml</code>, and create the ClusterRole using the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bash kubectl apply -f clusterrole.yaml</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Step 3: Bind the Service Account with ClusterRole</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, we need to bind the Service Account <code>my-service-account</code> with the ClusterRole <code>my-cluster-role</code>. This can be achieved by creating a ClusterRoleBinding. Execute the following command to create the binding:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bash kubectl create clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding --clusterrole=my-cluster-role --serviceaccount=default:my-service-account</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p>The above command creates a ClusterRoleBinding named <code>my-cluster-role-binding</code> that associates the Service Account <code>my-service-account</code> with the ClusterRole <code>my-cluster-role</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Verification:</strong></p>\n<p>To verify the successful binding, you can use the following command to check the ClusterRoleBinding:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bash kubectl describe clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p>You should see the Service Account and ClusterRole information listed under the <code>Subjects</code> and <code>RoleRef</code> sections, respectively.</p>\n\n<h2>Using Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes Cluster Lifecycle Management:</h2>\n<p>Meshery is a powerful service mesh management tool that simplifies the management and operation of service meshes, including <a href=\"https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kubernetes clusters</a>. MeshMap, a visual diagram feature of Meshery, provides a graphical representation of the service mesh components and their interactions.</p>\n\n<p>To utilize Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management, follow these steps:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Install Meshery</strong></p>\n<p>Refer to the official Meshery <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">documentation</a> to install Meshery on your local machine or within your Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Connect to Your Kubernetes Cluster</strong></p>\n<p>Once Meshery is installed, connect it to your Kubernetes cluster by configuring the necessary authentication and connection details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Access MeshMap</strong></p>\n<p>After successfully connecting Meshery to your Kubernetes cluster, you can access MeshMap from the <a href = \"https://playground.meshery.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meshery</a> user interface. MeshMap visually represents the deployed service mesh, including service endpoints, traffic flows, and workload distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Visualize the Kubernetes Cluster with MeshMap</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have accessed Meshery and connected it to your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps to visualize the cluster using MeshMap:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>From the Meshery user interface, navigate to the MeshMap section.</li>\n  <li>Select your connected Kubernetes cluster from the dropdown menu.</li>\n  <li>Click on the \"Generate Map\" button to generate a visual representation of the service mesh components and their interactions within the cluster.</li>\n  <li>Explore the generated MeshMap to gain insights into your Kubernetes cluster's architecture, traffic patterns, and workload distribution.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In this blog post, we have learned how to bind a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole to control access and authorization within a cluster. We have also explored how Meshery and its MeshMap feature can be used for visualizing the service mesh components and their interactions within a Kubernetes cluster. By following these steps, you can effectively manage and monitor your Kubernetes cluster's lifecycle using RBAC and visualization tools.</p>\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"How To Bind Kubernetes Service Account with ClusterRole","subtitle":"A Comprehensive Guide","date":"June 30th, 2023","author":"Layer5 Team","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/bb8ee/blog-post.png","srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/0dee1/blog-post.png 750w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/8beaa/blog-post.png 1080w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/bb8ee/blog-post.png 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/a66aa/blog-post.webp 750w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/65dd5/blog-post.webp 1080w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/edb28/blog-post.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}},"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/blog-post.png"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/86bab/blog-post.png","srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/e1b03/blog-post.png 125w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/81b70/blog-post.png 250w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/86bab/blog-post.png 500w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/8cf60/blog-post.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/46142/blog-post.webp 125w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/81c3e/blog-post.webp 250w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/cd07d/blog-post.webp 500w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/bf95e/blog-post.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"}]},"width":500,"height":281}},"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/blog-post.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/how-to-bind-kubernetes-service-account-with-clusterrole"}},{"id":"515bf6db-37bb-5a06-9892-326ee784c2f6","body":"\n\nimport MesheryVersion from \"./meshery-version.png\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<p>\n  Meshery is constantly evolving and improving, with new features and bug fixes being added regularly. To stay up to date with the latest Meshery features and updates, you can switch between different release channels.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Artifacts of the builds for Meshery and its components are published under two different release channels, so that improved controls may be provided to both  Meshery users and Meshery developers. The two release channels are edge and stable release channels. Relative to stable releases, edge releases occur much more frequently. Edge releases are made with each merge to master, unless that merge to master is for a stable release. Stable releases are made with each\n  merge to master when a GitHub release tag is also present in the workflow.\n</p>\n\n<h2> How release channels offer subscription </h2>\n<p>\n  Release Channels offers a subsciption where user can subscribe to a specific  release channel and get notified when a new release is available. This is  useful for users who want to stay up to date with the latest Meshery features, while also also providing flexibility for users who want to stay on a specific version of Meshery.\n  However, this approach can be risky because some updates may introduce bugs or compatibility issues that could break your existing installation. Depending upon your risk aversion and the nature of your deployment environment, having a subscription means that you will automatically receive these updates that you might not be ready incorporate. On the other hand, release channels also offer the ability to pin to a specific release which is a  good thing as it allows users to maintain stability and predictability of their environment by preventing unexpected changes from being introduced into their system. However, doing so cancels out any future subscription-based benefits such as receiving security patches or bug fixes that were added after that version was released.\n\nTherefore, it's important for you to weigh the pros and cons of each option before making decisions on how you want to manage your Meshery deployment. It's recommended you and your organizations have a well-defined upgrade strategy based on testing and validation procedures prior to applying new releases in production environments whether via subscriptions or manual upgrades to ensure that system availability is maintained and risks are minimized.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTo subscribe to a specific release channel or version using mesheryctl you can use \n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set [stable|stable-version|edge|edge-version] </code></pre>\nThis command will update your local Meshery configuration to use the selected channel for future updates. To set the channel to a specific version, replace Version with the desired version number. Example: <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set stable</code> or <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set stable-v0.5.56</code>\n</p>\n<h2> Switching between Release Channels</h2>\n<p>There are two ways to switch between Meshery release channels: using mesheryctl or by editing your meshconfig file. In this blog post, we'll cover both methods.</p>\n\n<h3>What is Meshconfig?</h3>\n<p>\n  Meshconfig is a configuration file that is used to configure Meshery. It is typically located in the <code>~/.meshery/config.yaml</code> directory. It contains information about the current release channel, the version of Meshery that is installed, and other configuration options that are specific to your Meshery installation. \n  Meshconfig is automatically generated when you run Meshery for the first time. It is also automatically updated when you update Meshery\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n<h3>Switching between Meshery release channels using meshconfig file.</h3>\n<p>Open your terminal and confirm that you have mesheryctl installed by running  <code>mesheryctl version</code>. If you don't have mesheryctl installed, you can install it by following the instructions in the  <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl\">Meshery documentation</a>.</p>\n<li>\nCreate new Meshery config.yaml file <pre><code className=\"language=bash\">mesheryctl system context create [context-name]</code></pre>\n</li>\nExample: <br/> <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context create new-context --components meshery-istio meshery-osm meshery-linkerd --platform docker --url http://localhost:9081 --set --yes </code>\n<li> To view the newly created meshery context use <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context view [context-name]</code></pre></li>\n<li>After making these changes, you can switch between different context by using <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context switch</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Switching between Meshery release channels using mesheryctl.</h3>\n<p>mesheryctl is a command-line tool for managing Meshery. You can use it to switch between different release channels. Here's how:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Run the following command to see the current configuration for Meshery:</li>\n<pre>\n<code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context view</code>\n</pre>\n<img src={MesheryVersion} className=\"image-center\"  style={{width: \"50%\"}}></img>\n<p>This will show you the currently channels ,<b>stable</b> or <b>edge</b>, along with the version number and other information.</p>\n<li>Run the following command to switch to a different release channel:</li>\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel switch</code></pre>\nThis command will update your meshconfig file to switch release channel and version of context in focus.

In this post,\n    we'll take a look behind the scenes at how each component in Meshery's\n    architecture plays a role in the management of many Kubernetes clusters.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n## Philosophy behind Meshery's multi-cluster management approach\n\nWhile designing Meshery for the world of many service meshes, and many Kubernetes clusters, much care has been taken to ensure that Meshery is an <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility\">extensible management platform</a>, ready for handling new types of infrastructure and new use cases rapidly through its plugin model. Under the hood, <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\">Meshery Server</a> acts as a delegator of operations by figuring out which Meshery Adapter registered its capability against the given operation. The operation is then sent to that given component (like one of Meshery’s service mesh adapters,e.g. Istio adapter) via a gRPC call. <img src={CoreArch} alt=\"deploy modal\"  className=\"image-right\" /> When the operation involves a Kubernetes cluster(s), the kubeconfig(s) is sent as a parameter to the RPCs. It is then the job of the handling adapter to respect that and perform the operation across the passed clusters from kubeconfigs as needed. The operations not requiring a kubeconfig are managed through the same RPC, with the only difference being that the handling component would ignore the `kubeconfigs` field altogether making the system work not just for Kubernetes, but for other cloud native use cases. This approach of reusing the same RPC for different types of requests is pretty common and sometimes debatable with the other approach of being strict with the RPCs. This is what makes Meshery completely pluggable and extensible.\n\n## Using multi cluster with Meshery\n\nFrom a client's perspective, there are two uses of the multi context feature in general. While deploying a <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> design or performing any other operation on their cluster(s), selecting any number of Kubernetes contexts will allow them to uniformly and parallely perform the operation across the clusters. And while visualizing the state of their cluster(s), the same context switcher will allow them to filter across the clusters whose view they want to see.\n\nAll cluster specific operations are now applied over a number of clusters uniformly. So if you have 10 clusters to manage and 8 of those start with the exact same set of pods, deployments, service mesh, etc then <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> can help you to apply these operations quickly and easily.\n\nIt is as simple as selecting the specific cluster(s) from the Kubernetes context switcher in the navbar, and then applying whatever operation you wanted to, whether that be deploying a sample app, a service mesh, or a <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> design.\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img src={Switcher} alt=\"context switcher\" className=\"image-center-shadow\" />\n</p>\n\nJust before applying the operation, you will be prompted with a confirmation modal which will provide the information about which cluster(s) that operation will be performed against. As the User interface improves, this same modal will also convey more useful information about the operation they are going to perform.\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img src={Deploy} alt=\"deploy modal\" className=\"image-center-shadow\" />\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n### Using MeshMap visualizer\n\nYou can switch between views of your cluster in visualizer mode while using <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link>.\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img\n    src={Cluster2}\n    alt=\"visualizer showing data of context1\"\n    className=\"slides-right\"\n  />\n</p>\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img\n    src={Cluster1}\n    alt=\"visualizer showing data of context2\"\n    className=\"slides-left\"\n  />\n</p>\n\n### Managing Meshery on multiple clusters\n\nUsers can perform cluster related operations from the settings page like adding more clusters, removing data from existing clusters and removing existing clusters.\n\n<img src={Settings} alt=\"Settings page\" className=\"slides-right\" />\n\nMeshery also deploys Meshery operator across the cluster it’s about to manage. This operator manages the lifecycle of a Meshery broker and MeshSync. MeshSync pumps the blood into Meshery’s core, in other words, it is responsible for watching all different types of resources by establishing a watch stream over each of them. MeshSync then pumps that data into the NATS server, of which Meshery server itself is a client. From there, Meshery server gets all the relevant data related to activities in the cluster.\n\nBy default, <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> wants to be as much aware about your infrastructure as possible to provide value so it deploys its operator across each detected cluster. But you can fine tune this configuration by going over each one of them from the table as shown.\n\n<img\n  src={Cluster}\n  alt=\"Kubernetes multi-cluster management with Meshery\"\n  className=\"image-center-shadow\"\n/>\n\nIf you disconnect your cluster and do not want to persist the data from that cluster then you can perform a fine-grained deletion by deleting all MeshSync data (which are the Kubernetes objects) for that specific cluster.\n\n<img src={Flush} alt=\"flushing MeshSync data\" className=\"image-center-shadow\" />\n## Future of multi-cluster\n\nMeshery as an extension point to your infrastructure provides out-of-the-box value by adding components which can be Kubernetes specific, service mesh specific or custom components to add new functionality. We can now add multi-cluster specific components to provide more abstraction. This model can be used along with Meshery’s multi-mesh capabilities to give an overall multi-mesh multi-cluster experience to the user. For instance, your Istio service mesh spanning across multiple clusters can be abstracted and managed by Meshery using custom components such as VirtualGateway and VirtualDestinationRules. In this case, Meshery’s Istio adapter will handle the logic of converting a VirtualGateway into gateways across the clusters. This abstraction provides high value by powering the service mesh to span across the clusters while the Ops team can configure the mesh with minimal effort.\n\nJust like the example above, many such Meshery extension points are in Meshery to add logic into and add useful functionality. And as more of such extension points are added, Meshery will continue to give more and more power to your cloud native infrastructure.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Management with Meshery","subtitle":"Wrangling your services one cluster at-a-time","date":"July 28th, 2022","author":"Ashish Tiwari","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoAAAABXRUJQVlA4IHQAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwDE2CF54D5t+bwgAP68SM3n4NvbowqxZAxrpC/QYjXpmca9fnDRt2vaA4crmoLs6No+L37Zc43rqKBUXdMCecvSw2drXRb5/RfsD7tY1aZ37HN/ekX7tRAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/c512e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp","srcSet":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/a66aa/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 750w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/65dd5/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1080w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/4fad6/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1366w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/c512e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoAAAABXRUJQVlA4IHQAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwDE2CF54D5t+bwgAP68SM3n4NvbowqxZAxrpC/QYjXpmca9fnDRt2vaA4crmoLs6No+L37Zc43rqKBUXdMCecvSw2drXRb5/RfsD7tY1aZ37HN/ekX7tRAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/cd07d/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp","srcSet":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/46142/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 125w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/81c3e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 250w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/cd07d/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 500w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/bf95e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":281}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery"}},{"id":"0bf099ea-9608-5c18-9882-81c42e07ea75","body":"\n\nimport mesheryui from \"./mesheryui.webp\"; \n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n<p><a href=\"https://meshery.io/\">Meshery</a>'s goal is to make the operation of cloud native infrastructure and the service mesh layer of cloud simplified.

Even if the project is small or too big, the creator or the team behind the project needs to curate the documentation very well such that it'll be useful for new end users to refer and learn to use the project, troubleshoot the problems occurred and lot more. Thus, we, Layer5 have curated the documentation for Meshery to meet such purposes. Not to mention, <code>mesheryctl</code>, the CLI client of Meshery needs a curated documentation as well. This blog describes about the evolution of <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page. </p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Initial Command Reference Design</h3>\n<p>\nThe initial design of <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page is all made using pure markdown and the functionality is handled using Jekyll, the main framework used for Meshery Docs. This handled great at initial stage but had many limitations, such as:\n    <ul>\n        <li>Updation of YAML for data is often required</li>\n        <li>Design was obselete at initial stage</li>\n        <li>No separate pages for each command and subcommand</li>\n    </ul>\n    Thus, the idea for redesigning the <code>mesheryctl</code> reference page was desperately needed.\n    </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\" alt=\"Meshery Documentation\" target=\"_parent\">\n    <img src = {oldDesign} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Initial design of mesheryctl command reference\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>Updated Command Reference Design</h3>\n<p>To tackle the shortcomings of the previous design, I was tasked to redesign the <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page entirely. This was a big task at first glance to me, as I was a new contributor back then. Eventually after manipulating the reference section with help of great folks, I was able to pull off the task and the design was updated. </p> \n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\" alt=\"Meshery Documentation\">\n<img src={newDesign} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Meshery CLI command reference\" /></a>\n</p>\n<p>The redesign work was done with help of HTML in markdown and with optimization in YAML code. A sample is given below.</p>\n\n```\n    <!-- Copy this template to create individual doc pages for each mesheryctl commands -->\n\n    <!-- Name of the command -->\n    # mesheryctl mesh\n\n    <!-- Description of the command. Preferably a paragraph -->\n    ## Description\n\n    {% assign name = site.data.mesheryctlcommands.cmds[page.command] %}\n    {{ name.description }}\n\n    <!-- Basic usage of the command -->\n    <pre className=\"codeblock-pre\">\n    <div className=\"codeblock\">\n    mesheryctl mesh [flags] \n    </div>\n    </pre>\n    ...........\n```\n\n<h3>Adding auto generation feature in reference</h3>\n<p>As time passed, we realized that the command reference missed something for a while, though the design has been changed. Then, we thought the idea of automating the generation of docs such that developers don't need to change the code in docs section while working towards <code>mesheryctl</code>. That's where we got to know that Cobra library (the library for CLI apps made using golang) has a feature to make doc pages automatically. So we decided to incorporate that feature into <code>mesheryctl</code> docs page as well! After making several changes and a PR, I was finally able to introduce the feature in the docs site!</p>\n\n```\nvar startCmd = &cobra.Command {\n\tUse:   \"start\",\n\tShort: \"Start Meshery\",\n\tLong:  `Start Meshery and each of its service mesh components.`,\n\tArgs:  cobra.NoArgs,\n\tExample: `\n// Start meshery\nmesheryctl system start\n// To create a new context for in-cluster Kubernetes deployments and set the new context as your current-context\nmesheryctl system context create k8s -p kubernetes -s\n// (optional) skip checking for new updates available in Meshery.\nmesheryctl system start --skip-update\n// Reset Meshery's configuration file to default settings.\nmesheryctl system start --reset\n// Silently create Meshery's configuration file with default settings\nmesheryctl system start --yes\n.....\n}\n\t`,\n```\n\n<p>Using this information provided above in each golang file, the markdown page is generated using Cobra CLI library and thus reducing the workload on the developer by automating via <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/.github/workflows/mesheryctl-ci.yml#L73\">GitHub Actions</a>.</p>\n<br />\n<p>This is so far on how the <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference is evolved for now. And I hope that it'll continue to evolve in the field of documentation to serve the users to use Meshery in best way possible.</p>\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Evolution of the Meshery CLI Command Reference","subtitle":null,"date":"June 9th, 2022","author":"Aadhitya Amarendiran","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABwBACdASoUAA0APtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJbACdMoGvtgJwx880HleA8ofTgAD+2VgctvGN2cFdfAJj4YJ0Ha8AiiMSiWh82G/yk9ZshKIR54QST0HBPk98AjqzxGHfuVZiMjvT9XDm39S3tEJ+oAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/f06bf/mesheryctl.webp 750w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/8c7d4/mesheryctl.webp 1080w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6316666666666667}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/mesheryctl.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABwBACdASoUAA0APtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJbACdMoGvtgJwx880HleA8ofTgAD+2VgctvGN2cFdfAJj4YJ0Ha8AiiMSiWh82G/yk9ZshKIR54QST0HBPk98AjqzxGHfuVZiMjvT9XDm39S3tEJ+oAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/704ce/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/5a879/mesheryctl.webp 125w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/6d26b/mesheryctl.webp 250w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/704ce/mesheryctl.webp 500w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/5c637/mesheryctl.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":316}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/mesheryctl.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/evolution-of-the-meshery-cli-command-reference"}},{"id":"10d40198-40a0-5d1e-8617-a75e432b771e","body":"\n\n\n\n\nimport { PerfbytesPodcast } from \"./perfbytesPodcast\";\nimport ConsulDemo from \"./consul-docker-extension-demo.webp\"\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n<PerfbytesPodcast>\n\n<h2>Podcast Insights</h2>\n<p>Many questions were asked, answered, and a variety of topics were discussed.

It is a solution to control how different parts of an application share data with one another. Unlike other systems for managing this communication, a service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer built right into an app. You have different options like the service type load balancer or using ingress but service mesh makes sense because it will manage a lot of features around your service to service communication.</p>\n</div>\n\nIn general, service meshes arose from the concept of proxies such as the NGINX proxy. Then Envoy was introduced by Lyft. Lyft had the architecture, and Google came along and created it. That gave us Istio, which is now part of CNCF. \n<Blockquote\n  quote=\"We were slugging it out in our labs trying to figure out how to do performance benchmarking with a service mesh. Instead of ten tools, if we had just one, it would be nice. Then we see Meshery come into the field\"\n  person=\"Mrittika\"\n/>\n\nService meshes, according to Lee, \"hit a real sweet spot personally\", having been focused on networking for most part of his career.\nHe believes that there are a couple of different ways to speak about the genesis of service meshes, with Linkerd being the first to coin the term.\nWe had Linkerd v1 written in scala and use jvm and then came Linkerd v2 which is something totally different at this point. It's all different code, different languages and  a different service mesh architecture. There's a number of different architectures by which service meshes are deployed. There's a new one that's been softly announced in beta from called Cilium that is helping bring back some of the different architectures of how to run the proxies.\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n<p>\nThe way I prefer to think about a surface mesh is that it's all about resiliency.\nIf you were to take a three-tiered web or three-tiered app and you think about how you're breaking out those tiers with some amount of\nkind of vertical scaling,  you'd probably, end up putting at least a virtual IP address out in front of the whole web tier and then you've got an app tier and a database tier because you've got multiple instances of those things. Maybe there's a load balancer in between.  This structure makes it simple to boost your resiliency.\n</p>\n</div>\n\nHenrik goes on to elaborate that in service mesh we can do a lot of things to make sure that the communication is reliable. \nWhen you design microservice architecture, there is a need of implementing retry logic. So if a service A needs to introduce another service B, then the service mesh will manage the retry logic such that if we reach at one time and the service B is not responding then the service mesh will try to reach out several times. Therefore a service mesh offers a variety of features like this to manage the certificates within the cluster and and circle them in a regular pace. You can also have traffic splitting if you do canary releases. In your service to service communication, there are a plethora of scenarios that the service mesh can handle.\nHenrik recalled that it's normally difficult to obtain a full view of what rules we've applied in the cluster, and when he first saw Meshery, his immediate thought was, \"Wow, this is exactly what is missing in the market at the moment.\"\n\n\nLets dig deeper into this tool we've been alluding to for a while now: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>.\n\n<h3>Meshery</h3>\nIf you were on a pager and were managing a large service mesh deployment with a number of rules and configurations around how security is enforced and identities are managed, and things like uniform observability and how metrics and logs are collected and enforced, and then the different traffic writing rules and stuff. You might soil myself if you had to go make a change in that sea of yaml. That's in part what we're working towards. There's a capability within Meshery for solving this challenge. As a cloud native management plane, Meshery presides over top of 10 different types of service meshes and it also presides over kubernetes. You can run it outside of kubernetes or inside of kubernetes.\n<p>\nMeshery has a number of components to its architecture. There is Meshery UI. It has a Mesheryctl, which is a CLI component. We have a number of service mesh adapters for each service mesh that Meshery supports.\n</p>\n\n<h5>What is the need for different adapters?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\nMeshery, as the multi-mesh manager, supports couple of different adapters. Adapters are used by Meshery to manage the numerous service meshes. Different service mesh adapters are written to expose the unique value of each service mesh. Consequently, they are not equally capable just as each service mesh is not equally capable as the other. Some of them work in a similar way. Some of the service meshes have their own differentiated value, which is why there are individual adapters. Some of them work slightly differently depending on whether they're running as a managed service or not.\n</div>\n\n\nWe have a plug-in for Meshery it's called <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link>, it is what you might consider a visual topology. It has a lot of use cases for observing in kind of a read-only mode. There's a second mode to this tool: The Designer Mode. It's a visual configurator of not only the specific settings within any of those service meshes that it supports like a circuit breaker and adjusting the sensor video\nbut also end up being a visual designer for your kubernetes deployments. When users drop in, they're able to go over and grab the specific capabilities of any of those service mesh adapters that are loaded for any of the versions of that mesh that they might want to design. The concept here is that they drag and drop these capabilities over and there's a bit of discoverability that's afforded through this ui rather than parsing through yaml, trying to understand what's going on.\n\n<img src={ConsulDemo} alt=\"Consul MeshMap Demo\" className=\"slides-right\" />\n\nI like to pretend that I know a lot about service meshes, but when it comes to having to keep track of all of them, I don't know what the gateway tls sds config is, and so this type of inline help is quite useful to design your deployments. The deployments may or may not use a mesh; in fact, you can use this to create your Kubernetes configuration and deployment as well.  You can even save and recall those designs.\n\nTaking this example of consul, produced by hashicorp, is a little more of an\nintriguing deployment and a simple two-tier deck.  We announced the <Link to=\"/docker-extension-meshery\">Meshery Docker Extension</Link> recently. So if you're using docker desktop, Meshery will be a first class app that's available inside of market and part of what it does as it integrates with docker desktop is it will import docker compose apps convert them to kubernetes manifests or kubernetes apps and they'll let you deploy those formerly docker compose apps onto a mesh which is why I'm talking about a two-tiered service.\n\n<h5>Does MeshMap allow you to load the current configuration that is has been applied in the current cluster?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\nCurrently, there are two modes: the one we were looking at before was the designer mode, and the one we'll be looking at now is the visualizer mode, which is probably a little more of an it's not entirely read-only to the extent that you could grab a pod and start an interactive session with the containers in that pod or you could you start a logging session. You could also initiate a performance test against  that particular service or that particular endpoint. \nMeshery supports three different types of load generators, which is a nighthawk, fortio and wrk2. \n</div>\n\n<h5>What are the capabilities of these three load generators? When you speak about service mesh testing or performance testing, what is actually the process behind the scene? What should users think about when they're starting a gig and need to configure and optimize the service mesh?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n<p>Lee expounds on that for our benefit. \nIt takes weeks to months that you've got to dedicate for performance engineers to go over and like pull together various tools and scripts around them to then get into a spreadsheet or into some database that you then generate results. \nThe genesis of Meshery part was to help people comprehend what a service mesh is, when to use one and which one to use?  As you go to explain these common questions, the real answer is a totally disappointing, which is, it just depends on what you're asking to do.  </p>\n<p>\nPeople want to measure it in cold hard quantitative metrics but if you're asking to do 100 percent sampling then also consider the distributed tracing implementation you had somewhere else and the fact that you're getting it\nin a uniform way here. Maybe you're likely to consider the overhead that you would have over there. It's frustrating to be trying to explain stuff to folks and get them excited about the tech and and to give them a vague response. Instead we give them a tool that says \"Hey look here's a tool that will deploy any of the service meshes that you want to test out.\" \n</p>\n<p>\nThere's a reason why there's ten of them like and actually many more than that.\nThere's a lot of overlap between them but different tools for different purposes for different size orgs, so it would be inappropriate to say well you know here's the one. It's rather hey here's a tool that that lets you deploy any number of them quickly, answer your own question about performance, because we can pump out benchmarks of the various service meshes under various configurations, using different types of workloads but which may or may not match your environment and over time those reports are going to get stale and so rather he's a tool to make you empowered.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h5>Do you actually generate traffic that will go through the sidecar proxy of the service and then reach out the actual service?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\nThat load is generated on demand or on schedule against one or more endpoints, one or more of your services or something that is not even on your service. You can generate load not only against something running within your infrastructure but something external as well to do statistical analysis based on the configuration that you gave it and so yeah the answer is yes the traffic flows through the sidecar.\n</div>\n\n<h5>If I say I have never scripted or built any scenarios for fortio or nighthawk. Let's say I'm a loadrunner, a neoload, or a k6 user, and I want to accomplish the same thing with them. So what is the journey on those load generator? is it the same thing you have to build a workflow of requests that you want to send in that scenario?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n<p>That leads us to probably talk about one of our other projects which is called <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">Service Mesh Performance</Link> which is a specification. It's another one of the projects that we've donated to the CNCF. Service Mesh Performance is the spec while Meshery is an implementation of the spec. At a high level, if those other load generators were to adhere to how we standardize and describe the test that you want to run and then hand off that configuration to generate the performance profiles that are created here  you're not gonna down download them but the descriptor is important.</p>\nThis implements a standard for the industry on what is the actual\nservice mesh test and then standardize the format so then anyone can use the same format to design their script or whatever they want and then use it to test. \nSo when I build a script, and I don't know loadrunner today and I want to use neologo tomorrow, then I don't have to rewrite everything.

Cloud native architectures call for horizontally scalable, distributed systems design with microservices proliferated from Cloud to Edge. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) Network’s objective is to enable widespread and effective development, deployment, and operation of resilient and intelligent network systems in cloud native environments, keeping an eye on the needs of workloads, developers who design them, and operators who manage them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Lee Calcote (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lcalcote\">@lcalcote</a>) is an innovative product and technology leader, passionate about empowering engineers and enabling organizations. As the founder and CEO of Layer5, he is at the forefront of the cloud native movement. Ken Owens (<a href =\"https://twitter.com/kenowens12\">@kenowens12</a>) is the Vice President, Cyber Cloud Security Engineering at FISERV. Owens is a technologist and an innovator with more than 20+ years of experience in a plethora of technologies and has been championing the cloud native movement for more than a decade now. \n</p>\n<p>\n    As an introduction to TAG Network, Owens  describes  the group’s  core objectives and reasons for its formation, summarized below:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Listening to ideas and collaborations</li>\n<li>Assisting and attracting projects</li>\n<li>Building communities and providing impartial stewardship</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Calcote and Owens are frequently asked a common question <em>“Is it important for the organization to be a part of CNCF to participate in the TAG Network group?”</em>. Owens emphasizes that anyone can participate, regardless of whether or not their company is a CNCF member organization. It does not require any payment and is an open-source effort in its spirit.\n</p>\n<h3>CNCF TAG Network Projects and various stages they go through:</h3>\n<img src={Projects} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"center\" alt=\"Tag Networks Projects\" />\n\n<p>\n    One of the important goals of the TAG Network is to identify the unique projects that want to participate and shepherd their journey through CNCF project levels. Project-fit and the process of assessment for inclusion in the CNCF require your project to be on terms with the following essential traits:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uniqueness</li>\n<li>Problem it solves</li>\n<li>Value it brings to the community</li> \n<li>Market demand</li>\n<li>Diversification </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Creating and stewarding any one of these projects is a significant undertaking. The  project's maintainers pitch the project and explicate how their project meets the above traits. \n</p>\n<p>\n    You start in a sandbox and work your way up to an incubation area once you've demonstrated a fundamental interest and understanding of the space, as well as some adoption. To graduate, the project must satisfy the required traits, be open-source, provide value and solve a problem effectively. We don't want to promote a CNCF project that is solely driven by one source. Diversification is crucial to the core of any CNCF project. Owens shared a subtle analogy, <em>\"a truly open source project is one in which contributors belong to the companies A+B+C...Z instead of just company A\"</em> \n</p>\n\n\n<h4>Working Groups and papers, and how they work.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Universal Data Plane API and Service Mesh WG are the two working groups stewarded by TAG Network.</li>\n<li>They utilize Kubecon to educate about the functioning of working groups.</li>\n<li>Whitepapers and publications are carried out by working group members. A Recent publication was published in the IEEE Bridge magazine, entitled <Link to=\"/resources/service-mesh-performance/analyzing-service-mesh-performance\">Analyzing Service Mesh Performance</Link>.</li>\n<li>Further goals include getting into the IEEE Communications Society and publishing an article entitled Techniques of Service Mesh Optimization.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe majority of the more detailed activities occur in the CNCF Service Mesh Working Group - a subgroup of TAG Network. The deep-dive unveiled many individual initiatives, the majority of which have a common thread: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>. Meshery is the cloud native management plane that enables the adoption, operation, and management of workloads.\n\n<p>\n    It's a Meshy world out there! As the ubiquity of service meshes unfolds and they become a commonplace for any cloud native or edge environment, so does the need for vendor and technology-agnostic interfaces to interact with them. Calcote gives us a walkthrough of two Service Mesh Specifications:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">Service Mesh Interface (SMI):</Link></b> SMI focuses on the interoperability of the various features of a service mesh.</li>\n<li><b><Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">Service Mesh Performance (SMP):</Link></b> SMP tries to make it uniform and succinct the way you characterize the performance of cloud native infrastructure with a focus on service meshes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<img src={Smi} className=\"slides\" align=\"center\" style={{marginLeft: \"10px\"}} alt=\"SMI\" />\n<img src={Smp} className=\"slides\" align=\"center\" style={{marginLeft: \"10px\"}} alt=\"SMP\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Owens and Calcote also discuss <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books/service-mesh-patterns\">Service Mesh Patterns</Link> and Service Mesh Catalog. These patterns promote the reuse of best practices, are service mesh agnostic, and also help in behavior analysis. A circuit breaker test is a good example.  If something goes wrong in your network be it a node failure, router failure, etc., then it helps you identify the point of failure as well as gets your network running quickly. \n</p>\n<img src={Catalog} className=\"slides\" alt=\"Service Mesh Catalog\" style={{display: \"block\", margin: \"0 auto 1.5rem\", width: \"60%\"}}/>\n\n\n<p>\n    Talking about distributed systems, we come across the problem of distributed analysis. In this talk, the TAG Network co-chairs help us understand this problem and why we must worry about it.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many performance characterizing tools are limited to single instance load generators. This limits the amount of traffic and the variety of behavioral analysis.</li>\n<li>Distributed load testing in parallel poses a challenge when merging results without losing the precision we need to gain insight into the high tail percentiles.</li>\n<li>How to model your service mesh topology and optimize for your ideal configuration in context of how much you value properties of resiliency, performance, throughput, latency, and so on before deploying to production. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    This brings us to <Link to=\"/projects/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</Link> and <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>. Together they help produce robust, distributed and scalable services. Distributed load testing offers insight into system behaviors that accurately represent real world behaviors of services under load as that load comes from any number of sources.\n</p>\n<img src={Gnh} className=\"slides\" style={{display: \"block\", margin: \"0 auto 1.5rem\", width: \"60%\"}} alt=\"GetNighthawk\" />\n\n<p><strong>Calcote and Owens packed a great deal of information in this talk.

Unit and integration tests bolster and roll up into broader end-to-end, functional testing performed across Meshery and the rest of its components. </p>\n\n<p>High levels of code coverage makes it easier for each project contributor to be confident that their code changes aren’t breaking any preexisting <code>mesheryctl</code> commands, side-swiping their functionality unknowingly, and consequently, unwittingly lowering the quality of Meshery's overall user experience.</p>\n\n<h3> mesheryctl lines of code</h3>\n\n\n```yaml\n\n    270 text files.\n    106 unique files.\n    166 files ignored.\n\n    cloc v 1.92  T=0.15 s (692.3 files/s, 110063.3 lines/s)\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Language       files          blank        comment           code\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Go                88           2128           1330          13045\n    YAML              12              0              0            215\n    JSON               4              0              0             42\n    make               1             10              2             31\n    Markdown           1             23              0             27\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    SUM:             106           2161           1332          13360\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n<p>Unit Tests can be written in two ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand\n        <ol>\n            <li>Mock Meshery(backend) response if needed</li>\n            <li>Grab console output</li>\n            <li>Store standard/verified mesheryctl output in a golden file(a text file)</li>\n            <li>Match the stored/expected output with what we grab from the console</li>\n            <li>Cover as many scenarios as possible, test the situations where errors must be thrown</li>\n            <li>This is a standard format, changes can be made accordingly</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> functions\n        <ol>\n            <li>This is the standard testing you may have come across in every project</li>\n            <li>You write one test dedicated to one function covering all possible test-cases, matching expected outputs</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Example tree graph</h3>\n<p>This example of a tree graph (from <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/4823\">meshery/meshery/pull/4823</a>) shows the impact given changes make on the level of code coverage.</p>\n\n<img src={TreeGraph} />\n\n<h3>Integration Tests</h3>\n\n<p>Integrations tests come into view when you cannot mock something easily and when a given behavior is cross-functional / cross-component. Integration tests put more, but not all of the focus validating system behavior and that the system completes all the necessary actions. Take <code>mesheryctl system start</code> for example. This command deploys Meshery, its adapters, and Kubernetes Operator; it starts Meshery. So, you run the command to start Meshery in a GitHub workflow and after running the <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand through the tests and make sure that Meshery actually started. And if the workflow successfully runs the test, then boom!, you aced your integration writing test... errr... test writing.</p>\n\n<p>The integration test writing exam can initially be challenging, but... that’s the fun in it. :) Running tests and making sure a command that is otherwise hard to verify, hard to test, and making it automatic through GH workflows.</p>\n\n<h3>How you can make an impact</h3>\n\n<p>Writing tests and making them work is in itself a tough task to do, so writing one test for a single function counts and makes a big difference over the long term. Don't hesitate. Start writing tests now. A single, new test is worthy of raising a pull request and will get you well on your way to learning much more about Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, and service meshes.</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://codecov.io/gh/meshery/meshery/\">Codecov</a> is used to check code coverage in <code>mesheryctl</code> (login with GitHub to get an in-depth idea of lines-of-code being covered in code coverage).</li>\n    <li>You can check the files on CodeCov’s website to figure out which mesheryctl commands haven’t been covered by existing tests.</li>\n    <li>Guide: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRlFpElRmybJ3WacgPKXgCSiQ2poJl3iCCV1dAalf0k/edit#heading=h.rzpmb66db1sq\">Writing tests for mesheryctl</a>. This guide will briefly introduce how tests are supposed to be written for mesheryctl.</li>\n    <li>Contributing to Tests doesn’t always mean writing new tests, It also means improving the effectiveness of already written-ones.</li>\n    <li> Search for Issues marked with area/tests in <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery\">GitHub - meshery/meshery</a>: Meshery, the cloud native management plane.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The impact that you make with by writing even a single test is quite high. Your tests will be executed and used time-and-time again. I can’t explain in words (I don’t have that good of a vocabulary). Your Tests are going to run in each pull request raised against the Meshery project, in each commit someone pushes to a pull request, in every nightly regression test suite, in every release. Just think: if another contributor incidently introduces a defect or doesn't consider for an edge case, and fails to uphold the intended behavior of the code, your tests are going to catch them redhanded. How cool is that?</p>\n\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? Jump in and write a few tests today! When you raise your pull request, label it with <code>area/tests</code> and <code>component/mesheryctl</code> and I'll be there to review!

A service mesh data plane is the collection of intelligent proxies that\n  operate in unison under the coordination of the control plane.

Essentially, a management plane helps\n  you integrate service meshes into your backend systems. A robust management\n  plane allows you to take full advantage of the power of the network while\n  integrating your service delivery processes seamlessly. Your management plane\n  might federate different types of service meshes, help you instigate chaos\n  through controlled experiments, or offer automated traffic splitting in order\n  to execute different styles of canarying of your applications.

In the future, if you want to\n  deploy a web assembly filter, you can describe that in a pattern as well and\n  have Meshery apply it. The patterns are service mesh agnostic, they're\n  reusable and the initial set of them is being stored in a public-facing\n  repository. There are almost 60 patterns that have been identified.\n  Ultimately, it will allow you to ingest these and measure then orchestrate and\n  apply them to your infrastructure.

Extension points allow you to  augment the behavior of Meshery by either adding entirely new capabilities or affecting the behavior of existing functionality, as see in the figure below.\n\n<div className=\"img-center\">\n  <a href={MesheryExtensibility} style={{backgroundColor: \"rgba(255,255,255,0)\"}}><img src={MesheryExtensibility} /></a>\n</div>\n\nAs you can see in the diagram, Meshery offers many types of extension points.\n\n- <strong>Extensible Service Mesh Adapters</strong> - bring your own service mesh.\n- <strong>Extensible APIs</strong> - bring your own GraphQL resolvers and expose new, custom endpoints.\n- <strong>Extensible Load Generators</strong> - Meshery supports three types of load generators, however, you can bring your own and plug it in.\n- <strong>Extensible Providers</strong> - the v0.5.0 release delivers dynamic injection of Remote Provider extensions. Providers are a powerful mechanism for integrating Meshery into your existing tooling and systems.\n\nThere are two types of Providers in Meshery: Local - built into Meshery and Remote - implemented by anyone or any organization that wishes to integrate with Meshery. Remote Provider extensibility includes:\n\n  * Pluggable UI functionality\n  * Pluggable Backend functionality\n  * Pluggable Authentication and Authorization\n  * Long-Term Persistence\n  * Enhanced Visualization\n  * Historical Reporting  \n\nLearn more about the platform Meshery provides to extend its funcionality by exploring its <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility\">extension points</Link>. If you have or are building your own <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility/providers\">Remote Provider</Link>, let us know!\n<h2>MeshKit and Meshery Adapter Library</h2>\n\nAs a service mesh toolkit, MeshKit aims to specifically focus on service mesh management and provides broadly useful functionality, it provides a standard policy for error handling and logging across all Meshery components, and implementations for error handling, logging, and tracing.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>MeshKit provides common data models of Service Mesh Interface conformance testing for Meshery.</li>\n  <li>The low-level API abstract by MeshKit to the high-level functions provides out-of-the-box functions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Meshery Adapter Library</h3>\n\n<p>The Meshery Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of functionality for managing the lifecycle of service meshes and their workloads.</p>\n<div className=\"img-center\">\n  <a href={MesheryAdapterLibrary}><img src={MesheryAdapterLibrary} /></a>\n</div>\n\n* The library provides a set of interfaces, some with default implementations like a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh-specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.\n* The default configuration provider we use Viper to reads the adapter specific configuration, and the configuration providers are implementations of an interface, this can be flexible if anyone wants to implement it on their own.\n\n<div className=\"intro\" style={{textAlign: \"center\", margin: \"2rem 4rem\"}}><p>Read <Link to=\"/community/members/michael-gfeller\">Maintainer Michael Gfeller</Link>'s blog post <Link to=\"/blog/meshery/introducing-meshkit-and-the-meshery-adapter-library\">Introduction MeshKit and the Meshery Adapter Library</Link> for more details.</p></div>\n\nWith the increasing the number and diversity of service meshes supported by Meshery, you might find the list of [Supported Service Meshes](https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes) a helpful, complete list.\n\n<h2>Meshery Operator</h2>\n<img style={{float: \"left\", maxWidth: \"300px\", width: \"20%\", padding: \"1.25rem\"}} src={MesheryOperator} />\n<p style={{display: \"block\", width: \"100%\"}}>\nAs a Kubernetes custom controller, Meshery Operator provides a Kubernetes-native approach to interfacing with Meshery. Kubernetes is where service meshes have gotten their initial foothold, and therefore, important that Meshery interface to Kubernetes natively.\n</p>\n<p>Some service meshes support non-containerized workloads outside of the cluster and will grow in this focus over time. While Meshery Operator is Kubernetes only in the v0.5.0 release, Meshery's arichitecture makes considerations for different workload and platform types.</p>\n\n<div style={{display: \"flex\", width: \"100%\"}}>\n  <div style={{textAlign: \"center\", flex: \"50%\"}}>\n    <a href={MesheryOperatorShot} style={{backgroundColor: \"rgba(255,255,255,0)\"}}><img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={MesheryOperatorShot} /></a>\n  </div>\n  <ul style={{flex: \"50%\"}}>\n    <li>Meshery Operator is the multi-service mesh operator that runs as a Kubernetes Operator and defines two custom resources: MeshSync and Meshery Broker (NATS)</li>\n    <li>Meshery Operator is provides abilities includes cluster discovery, service mesh discovery, and data streaming via NATS.</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3>MeshSync</h3>\n<p>MeshSync is available as a Kubernetes custom resource that provides tiered discovery and continual synchronization with Meshery Server as to the state of the Kubernetes cluster, service meshes, and their workloads.</p>\n\n<div style={{display: \"flex\"}}>\n<img style={{maxWidth: \"300px\", width: \"20%\", padding: \"1.25rem\"}} src={MeshSync} />\n<ul>\n\n  <li>MeshSync is one of a family of custom controllers within Meshery Operator and is the <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/meshsync\">heartbeat of Meshery</Link>, pumping information about service meshes and their workloads throughout Meshery's components.</li>\n  <li>MeshSync helps Meshery mesh with meshes by helping define a service mesh agnostic object model.</li>\n  <li>It provides ability to detect service meshes and services deployed on the cluster, and snapshot stored in-memory and refreshed periodically; \nmaintain the local snapshot of the cluster and refreshed periodically.</li>\n  <li>MeshSync These abilities above help Meshery operations more resilient.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n<h4>Relational Database</h4>\n\nMeshery's <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/database\">relational database</a> serves as a repository for MeshSync data, user preferences, and system settings.

This new API sets the stage preparing for  exciting features in upcoming releases. Extension points are also built into Meshery's GraphQL support allowing integrators to bring their own GraphQL resolvers to the Meshery server runtime.\n\n\n<h2>Meshery Command Line Interface Enhancements</h2>\nThe beloved `mesheryctl` introduces new commands in the v0.5.0 release expands the CLI's support of multiple Meshery deployments with the `context` command and control over when Meshery auto-updates with the `channel` command.\n\n<h3>Managing Multiple Meshery Deployments</h3>\nIntroduced in this release is the meshconfig - a configuration file that describes Meshery deployments in separate <i>contexts</i>. A Meshery <i>context</i> describes deployments across Docker hosts and Kubernetes clusters. <code>mesheryctl system context</code> enables user to easy manage multiple deployments of Meshery by quickly switching contexts. \n\n### Subscribing to Meshery Release Channels\n`mesheryctl system channel` allows you to easily set and switch between which Meshery release channel (stable or edge) that you want a particilar Meshery deployment (`context`) to use. Meshery deployments subscribe to one of two release channels and can either automatically self-update the deployment or prompt you to update the deployment. Alternatively, you can pin a given Meshery deployment to a specific release should you want tighter control over when Meshery updates.

MeshKit can be considered a derivative of `go-kit` with specific focus on service mesh management.\n\nIn the Meshery v0.5.0 release, MeshKit has been enhanced and expanded substantially. Considering that the MeshKit library provides broadly useful functionality, it is used in a growing number of Meshery components. It is intended to be one of the top level libraries in the Meshery ecosystem. <div className=\"fact\">Meshkit provides functionality useful across all Meshery components.</div>\n\nMeshKit is a toolkit for Layer5’s microservices, and is positioned to become Layer5’s middleware component for Layer5’s microservices, leveraging other libraries like `go-kit/kit`. In complement to functionality provided by a service mesh, its purpose is to provide implementations for common cross-cutting concerns like error handling, logging, and tracing. Uniform error handling and logging across all Meshery components helps to implement efficient tooling for observability, monitoring and troubleshooting. The library provides some common data models for Meshery, notably for <Link to=\"/smi\">Service Mesh Interface conformance testing</Link>, and Kubernetes' `kubeconfig`.\n\nAnother central component in Meshkit is the `utils` package.\n\nThis package provides a Kubernetes and a Helm client that implements functionality based on the Go libraries of these tools. The API exposed by these libraries is quite low-level, and the higher-level functions of the `utils` package simplifies usage of Kubernetes and Helm clients significantly.\nAnother advantage MeshKit that it is not necessary to use the command line versions of these tools, providing a more tailored experience for developers,\nand better logging and error handling integration.\n\n<Link to=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshkit\">MeshKit</Link> is simple and straight\nforward to use, as the following code example illustrates.{\" \"}\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"os\"\n\n\tmeshkitlogger \"github.com/layer5io/meshkit/logger\"\n\tmeshkitkubernetes \"github.com/layer5io/meshkit/utils/kubernetes\"\n\t\"k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// nginx contains the deployment manifest for nginx.\n\tnginx := `apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-deployment\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: nginx:1.14.2\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n`\n\n\t// Create an instance of the meshkit logger handler.\n\tlog, err := meshkitlogger.New(\"ExampleApp\",\n\t\tmeshkitlogger.Options{Format: meshkitlogger.JsonLogFormat, DebugLevel: false})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\tlog.Info(\"successfully instantiated meshkit logger\")\n\n\t// Detect kubeconfig on the local system.\n\tconfig, err := meshkitkubernetes.DetectKubeConfig()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\tlog.Info(config.Host)\n\n\t// Create Kubernetes client set for the detected kubeconfig using the Kubernetes Go client library.\n\tclientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\t// Create an instance of the meshkit Kubernetes client ...\n\tclient, err := meshkitkubernetes.New(clientset, *config)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\t// ... and use it to deploy nginx to the cluster.\n\terr2 := client.ApplyManifest([]byte(nginx), meshkitkubernetes.ApplyOptions{\n\t\tNamespace: \"default\",\n\t\tUpdate:    true,\n\t\tDelete:    false,\n\t})\n\tif err2 != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err2)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\tlog.Info(\"successfully applied the manifest\")\n}\n```\n\n## Meshery Adapters\n\nMeshery adapters are management plane components and manage the lifecycle of service meshes. This includes installation and deletion, configuration, and verification that an installation follows recommended practices. In addition, Meshery adapters can assess to what extent a service mesh complies to the <Link to=\"/blog/announcements/a-standard-interface-for-service-meshes\">Service Mesh Interface standard</Link>. Meshery adapters support management of multiple versions of their respective service mesh and also come bundled with sample applications that can be deployed for easy and quick exploration of service mesh capabilities. <div className=\"fact\">Meshery adapters manage the lifecycle of service meshes.</div>\n\nA Meshery adapter is a gRPC server that exposes the `MeshServiceServer` interface:\n\n```go\n// MeshServiceServer is the server API for MeshService service.\ntype MeshServiceServer interface {\n\tCreateMeshInstance(context.Context, *CreateMeshInstanceRequest) (*CreateMeshInstanceResponse, error)\n\tMeshName(context.Context, *MeshNameRequest) (*MeshNameResponse, error)\n\tApplyOperation(context.Context, *ApplyRuleRequest) (*ApplyRuleResponse, error)\n\tSupportedOperations(context.Context, *SupportedOperationsRequest) (*SupportedOperationsResponse, error)\n\tStreamEvents(*EventsRequest, MeshService_StreamEventsServer) error\n}\n```\n\n- `CreateMeshInstance` sets up the Kubernetes client. It does not, as the name might imply, create an instance of a service mesh.\n- `MeshName` returns the name of the mesh, configured in the adapter.\n- `SupportedOperations` returns all supported operations, configured in the adapter. An operation is e.g. the installation of a service mesh.\n- `ApplyOperation` executes the operation specified in the request. It is one of the supported operations.\n- `StreamEvents` allows sending events from the server to the client.\n\nThis API is one of the extension points of Meshery, making it easy to add support for new service meshes to Meshery. Meshery adapters abstract away differences in installation and configuration of the various service meshes.<div className=\"fact\">Adapters allow Meshery to interface with the different service meshes, exposing their differentiated value to users.</div>\n\nIn general, the various service mesh implementations are installed and configured in their own way. For instance, some service meshes have their own installer, like `istioctl` for Istio, while others use Helm charts, like Consul. One of the purposes of Meshery adapters is to abstract these differences away.\n\n## Meshery Adapter Library\n\nAs can be expected, adapters for the various meshes have a lot of code in common. Initially, this common code was copied from one adapter implementation to the next. The question arose whether common code should be factored out to one or several libraries. After some discussion, the community decided to move some of the more general code to Meshkit, and adapter specific code to a new library.\n\nThus, the Meshery Adapter Library was born.\n\nIt reduces the amount of boilerplate code in the adapters substantially, making adapter code easier to follow. This is especially valuable in an open source community where typically many developers contribute, for varying amounts of time. For the same reasons, it is important such libraries are easily understandable.\n\nAlso, it means new adapters can be implemented quickly, as only configuration and operations that differ between services meshes need to be implemented.\n\n<div className=\"fact\">\n  The Meshery Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of\n  functionality that Meshery adapters use for managing the lifecycle of\n  service meshes and their workloads.\n</div>\n\nThe initial commit was submitted on October 6th, 2020 based on a refactoring effort in the adapter for the Kuma service mesh. Within a few months, several adapters have been refactored or implemented from scratch based on the Meshery Adapter Library.\n\nThe main purpose of the Meshery Adapter Library is to:\n\n- provide a set of interfaces, some with default implementations, to be used and extended by adapters.\n- implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, error handling, and tracing.\n- provide a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.\n\nThe core interface in the library is the adapter `Handler` interface:\n\n```go\n// Interface Handler is extended by adapters, and used in package api/grpc that implements the MeshServiceServer.\ntype Handler interface {\n\t// GetName returns the name of the adapter.\n\tGetName() string\n\t// CreateInstance instantiates clients used in deploying and managing mesh instances, e.g. Kubernetes clients.\n\tCreateInstance([]byte, string, *chan interface{}) error\n\t// ApplyOperation applies an adapter operation. This is adapter specific and needs to be implemented by each adapter.\n\tApplyOperation(context.Context, OperationRequest) error\n\t// ListOperations list all operations an adapter supports.\n\tListOperations() (Operations, error)\n\n\t// Need not implement this method and can be reused\n\tStreamErr(*Event, error) // Streams an error event, e.g. to a channel\n\tStreamInfo(*Event)       // Streams an informational event, e.g. to a channel\n}\n```\n\nIt corresponds closely to the gRPC API discussed above, and indeed these methods are called in the implementation of the `MeshServiceServer` interface. This implementation is also part of the Meshery Adapter Library.\n\nUsing `struct` embedding, an adapter extends the default implementation `Adapter` of the interface `Handler` from the library.\nUsually, it is sufficient that this adapter handler overrides only the `ApplyOperation` function from the default implementation.\n(There, it is a no-op implementation.)\n\nThe figure below illustrates this and the usage of the library in an adapter.\n\n<img\n  src={mesheryAdapterLibrary}\n  className=\"image-center\"\n  alt=\"meshery adapter library\"\n/>\n\nIn the `main` package of the adapter, the default configuration provider `Viper` from the library is instantiated, and reads the adapter specific configuration. This includes a specification of all available operations. As configuration providers are implementations of an interface, you can choose any of the providers from the library, or implement your own.\n\nNext, an instance of the adapter handler is created. Other components, for instance a logger, may be created depending on needs and requirements, which is symbolize by the three dots in the figure.\n\nThe `service` is a struct that holds all the parameters that specify an adapter service, like the port the gRPC server is running on, and the instance of the adapter handler created in a previous step. This struct is passed to the `Start` function from the library. This `Start` function wraps the gRPC server, wiring up all necessary components, and starts the service. The developer does not need to touch any gRPC code.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nExtracting common code from adapters to the two new libraries has proven to be a worthwhile investment. It led to cleaner code as well as cleaner application architecture, shortened implementation time for new adapters considerably, and upleveled the quality of Meshery's adapters through consistency of implementation.\n\n\n<div className=\"intro\"><p>P.S.

Unable to engage all the user requests, the streaming service and the website broke down and ultimately resulted in DoS (Denial of Service). There are numerous examples of service crashes across different platforms, which has forced developers to take a closer look at performance benchmarking and pre-launch performance checks.\n\nThere are several advantages of preliminary service benchmarking, which may extensively enhance the response time, resolve glitches, enhance the application's robustness, and bring together several other commendable factors, including but not limited to stability and dependability within an application.\n\nThere are several tools for performance benchmarking. A major one is the interconnected relationship between load generators and benchmarks. Some of the well-known load generators in the cloud native realm are:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Fortio</li>\n    <li>Wrk2/Wrk</li>\n    <li><a href=\"/projects/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</a></li>\n</ul>\n\nThe conclusion can be encapsulated as following, Meshery, the cloud native management plane possesses the ability to generate load and benchmark services in/out of your service mesh using Fortio, Wrk2 and now, Nighthawk too.\n\n### Meshery + Nighthawk = Robust Distributed and Scalable Services\n\nNighthawk, written and maintained by the Envoy Community, is a L7 (HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2) performance characterization tool that supports performance benchmarking using HTTP or gRPC services.\n\nNighthawk is built using open-source builds and test tool Bazel and supports output formatting to well-known formats, allowing integration with other systems and dashboards. To add more to the list, it will soon support distributed performance benchmarking which is currently under an active development stage.\n\nOn the other hand, Meshery, written and maintainer by Layer5 Community is the multi-service mesh management plane offering lifecycle, configuration and performance management of service meshes and their workloads. With Meshery, you can both, manage your service mesh's lifecycle, and benchmark them with industry-grade tools to let you know how much under or over-utilized your services are.\n\n<img src={smpImg} alt=\"smp-image\" className=\"image-left smp-image\"/>\n\nSoon, Meshery is going to be a canonical implementation for [Service Mesh Performance](https://github.com/layer5io/service-mesh-performance) which is a common and standardised format to describe : - Performance test configuration - Service mesh configuration - Environment configuration - Workload configuration - Performance test results.\n\n### How did we achieve it ?\nThe following project was proposed as a Google Summer of Code Idea, I was selected as a student mentee to draft the design, architecture and code my way from scratch. On my journey, I received guidance from some amazing mentors, colleagues and open-source stake holders. I discussed the design proposal with Envoy Team as well as Layer5 Team and from suggestions from both, I was able to complete my project.\n\nIn the course of the project, I came up with the idea of invoking Nighthawk as a separate container with which Meshery will communicate using a go-lang based middleware.\n\nTo my elation, the project was a huge success and Nighthawk is now invoked as a load-generator in Meshery. Soon, the public release for the new version will be made and users will be able to utilize Nighthawk as a performance-benchamark tool alongside with Fortio and Wrk2.\n\n### What's next?\nThis is just the first relay, in the long run, there are many more milestones to come. The following is a list of projects which will be completed in upcoming months:\n\n- Invoke Nighthawk as an gRPC Service and support gRPC connection between Nighthawk & Meshery.\n- Implement user-profiles for performance benchmarking which may store some preset preferred values according to users.\n- Enhance Nighthawk to support distributed load generation and performance benchmarking.\n- NATS & gRPC Performance Benchmarking for gRPC and NATS services invoked in Meshery.\n\nand many more awesome and bleeding-edge ideas.\n\n### How can I get involved?\nIf any of this sounds remotely exciting, I implore you to give this a chance. You won’t regret it. Head over to our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and join the #performance channel where everything related to performance testing is discussed. We would love to hear your feedback.

New releases for Meshery are published on a frequent cadence with new features and bug fixes. Today, we are announcing version 0.4.0 of Meshery. This summary highlights Meshery's latest developments and elucidates new features.\n\n## What's New?\n\nThe v0.4.0 release of Meshery introduces a plethora of new features and bug fixes across service mesh environments spanning Meshery and it's various adapters.\n\n### Meshery's CLI: `mesheryctl`\n**New Command Structure**<br/>\n`mesheryctl` commands and subcommands have been restructured in v0.4.0 into the categories:\n- Global Commands and Flags\n- Meshery Lifecycle Management\n- Performance Management\n- Service Mesh Lifecycle Management\n- Workload Lifecycle Management\n\nOrganizing commnands [under these categories](https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl) is done with both the intention to make `mesheryctl` functions intuitively at your fingertips, but also to make room for forthcoming functionality.\n\n**Exposing Performance Management in the CLI**<br/>\n`perf:` a new `mesheryctl`command. Introduction of new performance sub-commands, now benchmark your service mesh at the tip of your fingers using our new CLI command `perf`.\n\n**Support for Scoop** <br/>\nSupport extended to Scoop Bucket. You can now install mesheryctl on your Windows machine with Scoop Bucket. Visit the [Meshery Scoop Bucket](https://github.com/layer5io/scoop-bucket) to install Meshery on Windows.\n\n**Rename `cleanup` to `reset`**<br/>\nThe `cleanup` is used to reset your Meshery deployment configuration back to its default settings. This command has been renamed to `reset` to more appropriately reflect its purpose.\n\n### MeshSync<br/>\n<img src={operator} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"meshery-operator-dark\" />\n\n-  A component of the [Meshery Operator](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-operator), MeshSync can scan the environment to get the deployment details of specific types of service meshes and the connected Kubernetes cluster.\n-  MeshSync is a new component addition to Meshery. Meshery needs to be constantly updated given that service meshes and their underlying infrastructure are dynamic, constantly changing.  Meshery operations should be resilient in the face of this change.\n-  MeshSync brings a service mesh agnostic object model that defines relationships between all objects under management.\n\n### Meshery Adapter for Citrix Service Mesh (beta)<br/>\n\n<img src={MesheryArchitecture} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"meshery-architecture\" />\n\n- [Citrix Service Mesh](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-cpx) is now a supported service mesh. Meshery incorporates support for the Citrix ADC CPX, which is a cloud-ready, container-based application delivery controller that can be provisioned on a Docker host.\n- CPX runs as the Istio Data Plane component, displacing Envoy as the default data plane service proxy.<br/>\n\n### Security & Authentication\n\n- Meshery has moved from using session authentication to JWT authentication. Meshery's JWT authentication is powered by Hydra Auth.\n- You can now opt to authenticate yourself on mesheryctl while performing performance tests using `mesheryctl`, you can authenticate yourself by getting the JWT Token from Meshery UI.\n\n### Meshery Server\n\n- Support provided for [wrk2 as an alternative load generator](https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management#load-generators).\n- [Providers](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility) - A new project construct that allows users to select authentication, long-term storage etc.\n- Ad-hoc [connectivity tests for Prometheus and Grafana](https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management#grafana-and-meshery) are now supported.\n- Extraneous information beyond IP address and port in Grafana and Prometheus endpoints have been stripped off.\n\n### Meshery UI\n\n- ES-Lint has been added to the client side to ensure the quality of code and increase maintainaiblity of code.\n- Cypress has been set-up to enable end-to-end tests and integration tests for Meshery UI.\n\n<center><iframe frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowFullScreen={true} mozallowFullScreen=\"true\" webkitallowFullScreen=\"true\"frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowFullScreen={true} mozallowFullScreen=\"true\" webkitallowFullScreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds9D2KgZKxo\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></center>\n\n\n### Other notable changes\n\n- From within the [Meshery Continuous Integration Working Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds9D2KgZKxo&list=PL3A-A6hPO2IM7rYiKxG4l3eQNc6X3IUex), we have strengthened our continuous integration (CI) actions & tests by introducing new workflows like `static check`, `vet check`, `security check` for our server code.\n- ReleaseDrafter & WelcomeBot has been added to the repository to enable automation of release notes and for welcoming new contributors, respectively.\n\nTo get a more comprehensive list of the bug fixes and enhancements packaged in the v0.4.0 release, see the [Meshery Documentation](https://docs.meshery.io/project/releases)\n\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing Meshery v0.4.0","subtitle":"","date":"August 7th, 2020","author":"Layer5 Team","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsoAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSGYAAAABgCsAgIHqqtHm5JrcZNvWxqvd2GwbYz1u7yf5ARGR4N+JIZRCqIZQBSQ+aIdJPY+dC3seH6nRZlTtfN27zv5n8B0Vs5jm+2qmdSqD7LBa0lUQRfBdDgvPIlGJVCQJR0JTiTjw/wBWUDggPgAAADADAJ0BKhQADQA+0VakS6gko6GwCAEAGglpAAB60b/b/AAA/vAi9+Ax+ANYXYVXicTSFmjmW1J3l211gAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp","srcSet":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp 500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.666}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/meshery-v040.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsoAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSGYAAAABgCsAgIHqqtHm5JrcZNvWxqvd2GwbYz1u7yf5ARGR4N+JIZRCqIZQBSQ+aIdJPY+dC3seH6nRZlTtfN27zv5n8B0Vs5jm+2qmdSqD7LBa0lUQRfBdDgvPIlGJVCQJR0JTiTjw/wBWUDggPgAAADADAJ0BKhQADQA+0VakS6gko6GwCAEAGglpAAB60b/b/AAA/vAi9+Ax+ANYXYVXicTSFmjmW1J3l211gAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp","srcSet":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/b6c82/meshery-v040.webp 125w,\n/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/48571/meshery-v040.webp 250w,\n/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":333}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/meshery-v040.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/announcements/announcing-meshery-v040"}},{"id":"fbdb0105-a11c-58b8-b99e-f59449dd09f9","body":"\n\nimport cncf from \"./cncf-landscape-stacked-color.svg\"\nimport cncfmeshery from \"./cncf-meshery-landscape.webp\"\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img src={cncf} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"cncf-landscape-stacked-color\" />\n\n### Digging into Service Meshes\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I got interested in service mesh technology. A customer needed some advanced routing capabilities and we started looking at Envoy and Istio. Then - invitations to talk about Istio at meetups and conferences started flowing in. That's when I got excited about progressive delivery capabilities that service meshes enable. I even wrote a Kubernetes Istio canary controller - BirdWatch.\n\n### Finding Meshery\n\nDigging deeper into what service meshes had to offer I discovered Meshery - the universal service mesh management plane. And immediately joined Layer5 - the great, welcoming open-source community that created it.\n\n### Community Matters\n\nBeing a member of Layer5 was one of the nicest community experiences I've ever had. Mainly thanks to community's founder and captain - Lee Calcote. He always makes sure everybody feels significant, included and motivated to participate. And this spirit spreads out to all community activities.\n\nIn no time, I had my first commits approved and merged and started joining weekly community and development video calls.\n\n### We're on CNCF Landscape!\n\nNow - I won't be reviewing Meshery in this post. I've spoken about it in this video and some great introductory articles by community members can be found here and here. This post is more of a celebration, because last week...\n\n<h5 style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}><i>Meshery now featured in the CNCF Landscape!</i></h5>\n\n<img src={cncfmeshery} className=\"image-center\" alt=\"cncf-meshery-landscape\" />\n\nAnd this is only the first step - there's already an application filed for Meshery to become a full-fledged CNCF sandbox project. I had a chance to collaborate on the sandbox proposal and am so eager for this to happen.\n\n### Getting Meshy\n\nThis is also an invitation to participate - Meshery is a young, ambitious project - it requires a ton of work to make it what it aims to become. Integrating with all of the leading service mesh solutions asks for extensive expertise. In many areas Meshery's functionality is still young. But these are normal growth stages, aren't they? To put it simple - the community and the project need more hands! And these should be your hands!\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}><i>As already mentioned - Layer5 is a very welcoming bunch!</i></p>\n\nOpen source contributions are a must-do for becoming a true cloud native hero. Cloud native is all about the community and one can't be a part of a community by only taking and never giving back. So if you were looking for a promising and welcoming project to join - look no further! Hop on to Layer5 Slack and we'll happily embrace you and help you get started.\n\nAnd it's not only coding! Documentation, testing, UI design, logos, blogs, videos - you decide where to apply your talent.\n\nFor example - I sometimes wish I had more time and motivation to code new Meshery features or fix existing bugs. But instead I'm writing this post. Because lately I enjoy writing texts more than coding. Coding for longer than a couple of days at a time throws me into a coding fatigue… Actually also many other activities do. I'm just not very good at keeping a routine. But I'm sure many of you out there aren't like me. So why not join forces?\n\n### Join the cloud native community!\n\n* Meshery is an exciting opportunity to learn more about service meshes.\n* We're already on CNCF Landscape and are headed for the sandbox.\n* Now is a great time to hop on board. Are you ready? Get into the mesh pit!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Meshery lands in the CNCF Landscape","subtitle":"This is a story about growing together as a community and building a project that matters.","date":"June 1st, 2020","author":"Anton Weiss","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABQBACdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZACdMoADgO9k6qEL53yk2sYAAP7Abw4XvX2jHGD89BNjRpE70cE2XMKPwIVX+4lLfd3o20v5GElRvyyyUrRwSFT2h/RDZdLxUwq/W4DautwG0qJ1AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/82c33/cncf-meshery.webp","srcSet":"/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/678bf/cncf-meshery.webp 750w,\n/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/00510/cncf-meshery.webp 1080w,\n/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/82c33/cncf-meshery.webp 1250w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.504}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/cncf-meshery.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABQBACdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZACdMoADgO9k6qEL53yk2sYAAP7Abw4XvX2jHGD89BNjRpE70cE2XMKPwIVX+4lLfd3o20v5GElRvyyyUrRwSFT2h/RDZdLxUwq/W4DautwG0qJ1AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/9a9c3/cncf-meshery.webp","srcSet":"/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/f6072/cncf-meshery.webp 125w,\n/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/68a14/cncf-meshery.webp 250w,\n/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/9a9c3/cncf-meshery.webp 500w,\n/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/9f3d1/cncf-meshery.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":252}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/c201715de532db5e6e35ab46bb613fee/cncf-meshery.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/announcements/meshery-lands-in-the-cncf-landscape"}},{"id":"58ae43e0-f0b0-5c61-ab4f-b71e722508cc","body":"\n\n\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n### Introduction to Meshery\n\nFor all those who are unaware of <a href=\"/meshery\">Meshery</a>, Meshery is a multi-service mesh management plane which provides users with service mesh operational best practices, lifecycle and configuration management, but also interoperates between various service meshes, while enabling you with the tools and knowledge to glean the most of out your service mesh performance, while keeping your overhead to a minimum.\n\nMeshery's vision is to make the operating of any service mesh layer of cloud infrastructure simplified, and to hasten the inevitable, eventual, ubiquituous adoption service meshes as a pervasively present layer of any the way that any modern workload is designed and deployed.

With `mesheryctl`, not only you can manage your adapters & containers but you can also benchmark your mesh using the command line. `mesheryctl` provides support to a number of platforms so that we never miss out users. `mesheryctl` can be installed with a single bash command by simply executing:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n````\n\nin your terminal. You will see Meshery getting installed & fired up on port: 9081.\nYou will see the output as\n\n\n```\nExtracting mesheryctl-v0.3.14...\nArchive:  /Users/user/meshery.zip\n  inflating: LICENSE\n  inflating: README.md\n  inflating: mesheryctl\n\nInstalling mesheryctl in /usr/local/bin.\nmesheryctl installed.\npermissions moved to user\nRemoving installation files and opening Meshery...Updating Meshery now...\nPulling meshery          ... download complete\nPulling meshery-istio    ... done\nPulling meshery-linkerd  ... done\nPulling meshery-consul   ... done\nPulling meshery-octarine ... done\nPulling meshery-nsm      ... done\nPulling meshery-cpx      ... done\nPulling watchtower       ... done\n```\n\nand you will be able to see the Meshery UI on `https://localhost:9081`.\n\nIf you are wondering if bash is only way to get `mesheryctl`, then here is the list of platforms which you can get `mesheryctl describing all the different ways to get it.\n\n<table className=\"table-1\" align=\"center\">\n<thead>\n    <tr>\n    <th align=\"left\">Platform</th>\n    <th >Supported?</th>\n    </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <td ><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/docker\">Docker</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/docker\">Docker - Docker App</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/kubernetes\">Kubernetes</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/aks\">Kubernetes - AKS</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Kubernetes - Docker Desktop</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/eks\">Kubernetes - EKS</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/gke\">Kubernetes - GKE</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/kubernetes#helm\">Kubernetes - Helm</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/minikube\">Kubernetes - Minikube</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - Kubernetes - OpenShift</td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">In Progress</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Linux</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Mac</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl#homebrew\">Mac - Homebrew</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/windows\">Windows</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl#scoop\">Scoop</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/windows#wsl\">WSL2</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td>Raspberry Pi</td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">In Progress</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<br/>\nWe believe we have not missed any of the popular platforms for what it’s worth, we will be rolling out support for RaspberryPi and OpenShift soon 🎉🎉🎉.\n\nIf you are thinking about the requirements you would have to run `mesheryctl`, so to your surprise, to successfully run `mesheryctl` you will only need :\n\n<table align=\"center\" className=\"table-box\"><tbody><tr><td className=\"text-centre\">a running Docker daemon</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n### Into the MesheryCTL\n\nOnce you have successfully installed, you will be having the power of a new CLI Command MesheryCTL. As you type `mesheryctl` into your terminal, you will be shown with the various sub-commands and flags `mesheryctl` can support.\n\n```\nMeshery is the cloud native management plane, providing lifecycle, performance, and configuration management of service meshes and their workloads.\n\nUsage:\n  mesheryctl [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:\n  help        Help about any command\n  perf        Performance Management\n  system      Meshery Lifecyle Management\n  version     Print mesheryctl version\n\n\nFlags:\n      --config string    config file (default location is: $HOME/.meshery//meshery.yaml)\n  -h, --help            help for mesheryctl\n  -v, --version         Version of mesheryctl\n\nUse \"mesheryctl [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\n```\n\nOnce you do `mesheryctl system start`, Meshery will pull its adapters and latest docker images. Meshery will also detect your Kubernetes configuration and will let you know if Kubernetes is running. Meshery will run it’s web-based user interface on localhost port `9081` and will let you select your choice of <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility#providers\">Provider</a> before you can start managing your service meshes with this powerful utility.\n\n<table align=\"center\" className=\"table-box\"><tbody><tr><td className=\"text-centre\">One of the most interesting sub-commands of <code>mesheryctl</code> is <strong><code>perf</code></strong>.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nThe `perf` subcommand enables you to being managing the performance of your service mesh deployment and your workloads running atop of them. It lets you benchmark your service mesh without using the Meshery UI from the command line interface itself. Once you type `mesheryctl perf`, it will present you with all the powerful flags you can control with CLI, including providing it with a `--file` flag that points to any of a number of performance test profiles that you may have saved.\n\n```\nPerformance Management and Benchmarking using Meshery CLI.\n\nUsage:\n  mesheryctl perf --[flags]\n\nAvailable Flags for Performance Command:\n  name[string]                  (optional) A short descriptor to serve as reference for this test. If not provided, a random name will be generate.\n  url[string]                   (required) URL endpoint to send requests.\n  duration[string]              (required) Length of time to perform test (e.g 30s, 15m, 1hr). See standard notation https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration\n  load-generator[string]        (optional) Name of load generator to be used to perform test (default: \"fortio\")\n  mesh[string]                  (optional) Name of the service mesh to be tested (default: \"None\")\n  provider[string]              (required) Choice of Provider (default: \"Meshery\")\n  concurrent-requests[string]   (optional) Number of parallel requests to be sent (default: \"1\")\n  qps[string]                   (required) Queries per second (default: \"0\")\n  file[string]                  (optional) file containing SMPS-compatible test configuration. See https://github.com/layer5io/service-mesh-performance-specification\n  help                          Help for perf subcommand\n\nurl, duration, concurrent-requests, and qps can be considered optional flags if specified through an SMPS compatible yaml file using --file\n```\n\nAn example usage of `mesheryctl perf --[flags]` can be\n\n```bash\n mesheryctl perf --name \"a quick stress test\" --url http://192.168.1.15/productpage --qps 300 --concurrent-requests 2 --duration 30s --token \"provider=Meshery\"\n```\n\nYou can also provide a SMPS Configuration file with `perf` subcommand, with this file provided you will not have to specify url, duration, concurrent-requests & qps. However, if specified the value provided through file will be over-rided by value through CLI.

Microservice architectures brought on as many challenges as they have advantages. With operational complexity being one of the most acute pains. Service meshes do offer solutions to a number of these operational concerns. Including but not limited to: resilience, improved observability, security and advanced service discovery.\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXQV-i-Hkf8\" loading=\"lazy\" frameBorder=\"0\"\n    allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n    style={{minHeight: \"315px\", minWidth: \"280px\"}}></iframe>\n</div>\nBut with so many mesh options around - how do we choose, evaluate and compare them? And once we’ve chosen a solution - how do we make it accessible to all our engineers? It is to provide an answer to these questions that the Layer5 community has created <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>, the open-source, service mesh management plane. Meshery already supports a number of leading mesh providers with adapters for additional meshes on the way. In today’s video, I’ll show how to use Meshery for rolling out and evaluating Linkerd.\n\n Linkerd is a system that comes from the service mesh pioneers - the company called Buoyant. They were the first to realise the need for a distributed network of smart, centrally configured proxies and coin the term “service mesh” back in 2016. Today, we’ll be looking at Linkerd 2.x - the second generation of this now CNCF project.\n</div>\n<div>\n<h5>Meshery Adapters</h5>\n    <table className=\"table-adapters\">\n        <thead className=\"hidden\">\n            <th>Status</th>\n            <th>Adapter</th>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td rowSpan=\"7\" className=\"stable-adapters\">stable</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-istio\">\n                <img src={istio} alt=\"Istio Service Mesh adapter\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Istio\n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-linkerd\"><img src={linkerd} alt=\"Linkerd\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Linkerd</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-consul\"><img src={consul} alt=\"Consul Connect\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Consul</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-octarine\"><img src={octarine} alt=\"Octarine Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Octarine</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-nsm\"><img src={nsm} alt=\"Network Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Network Service Mesh</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td className=\"stable-adapters\"/></tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td rowSpan=\"2\" className=\"beta-adapters\">beta</td>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-cpx\">\n                <img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQksHj15DkID308qQw3cmkQrRULPxyzbVquSZVev-9dj1L6sPs-rQ&s\" alt=\"Citrix CPX Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Citrix CPX\n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td className=\"beta-adapters\"/></tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td rowSpan=\"6\" className=\"alpha-adapters\">alpha</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-maesh\">\n                <img src={maesh} alt=\"Maesh Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Maesh\n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-app-mesh\">\n                <img src={awsappmesh} alt=\"AWS App Mesh Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for App Mesh \n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-kuma\">\n                <img src={kuma} alt=\"Kuma Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Kuma\n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr><tr>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td className=\"alpha-adapters\"/></tr>\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n</div>\n\nSome things that Linkerd is known for:\n\n<li>Purpose-built for Kubernetes</li>\n<li>Featuring custom-built, highly performant proxies written in Rust</li>\n<li>Zero-config option (works out-of-the-box)</li>\n<li>Network telemetry built-in (includes a pre-configured, optimised Prometheus instance)</li>\n<li>Low-overhead control-plane</li>\n<li>Operational simplicity (when compared to Istio, for example, even though Istio is getting better in this regard)</li>\n\nSo what is covered in the video?

In the follow-up videos, we’ll dive deeper into many of these concepts. And also show how to use Meshery with other service mesh providers.\n\nThis video is also the opening shot of Layer5's [Learn to Service Mesh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3A-A6hPO2IN_HSU0pSfijBboiHggs5mC) playlist, which is specifically dedicated to tutorials and webinars.

[Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery), which is the multi-service mesh management plane.\n2. [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d), which is used to create a dockerized [k3s](https://k3s.io) server.\n\nAnd, what really appealed to me about both of them is that everything from the installation to the usage was just *simple!*\nAnd cream on the top, both softwares are used with or inside containers, making each ideal for a create/try/delete workflow.\n\n<h4>Environment Setup</h4>\n\nBefore we start having *real* fun with Meshery, I will quickly list the different components I used for this blog post and ensure I define what could be optional for your own setup:\n1. [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery)\n2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)\n    - Docker is of course mandatory and as Meshery is based on a Compose file, which means that [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is also mandatory.\n3. [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d)\n    - k3d or any k3s/K8s cluster that you might have already configured.\n4. [WSL2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/)\n    - For the (few) ones who know me, my \"OS base\" is WSL2, which means that without much/any change, it should run fine for any Linux/MacOS setup.\n5. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) *(optional)*\n    - Grafana is not mandatory however is strongly recommend. We will setup a dockerized instance, but feel free to plug Meshery with your existing instance.\n\n<h4> Nothing is taken for granted </h4>\n\nFor the sake of making the blog post around Meshery, I won't explain how to install each component and will focus only on getting k3d and Meshery working.\n\nThat said, I do not take anything for granted and as Scott Hanselman once taught me: there is no \"just have to ...\" or \"by simply doing ...\".\n\nIf you face any issue with your setup (hopefully WSL2), just let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nunixtech) or on the [Layer5 Slack channel](http://slack.layer5.io).\n\n<h4>Meshery Installation</h4>\n\nFor the following steps, I will use the Ubuntu 18.04 WSL2 distro:\n\n- Start docker and confirm it's running:\n\n```bash\nsudo service docker start\ndocker version\n```\n\n- Using Docker, install Meshery on your local machine by running the following:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n```\n<a href={wsldockerstart}>\n    <img src={wsldockerstart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wsl-docker-start\" />\n</a>\n\n- Create a new k3d cluster with the <code> WSL2 IP </code>\n\n```bash\nexport mainIP=`hostname -I | awk '{ print $1 }'`\nk3d list\nk3d create --workers 3 --api-port ${mainIP}:6443\nexport KUBECONFIG=\"$(k3d get-kubeconfig --name='k3s-default')\"\nkubectl cluster-info\n```\n\n<a href={wslk3dstart}>\n    <img src={wslk3dstart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslk3dstart\" />\n</a>\n<br/>\n- Start Meshery on the newly created cluster\n\n```bash\nmesheryctl system start\n```\n\n<a href={wslmesherystart}>\n    <img src={wslmesherystart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslmesherystart\" />\n</a>\n- Once Meshery is fully started, login in your preferred browser using the <code>WSL2 IP</code> instead of <code>localhost</code>\n\n```bash\nexport BROWSER=/mnt/c/Firefox/firefox.exe\n$BROWSER $mainIP:9081 &\n```\n\n<a href={wslmesherylogin}>\n        <img src={wslmesherylogin} alt=\"wslmesherylogin\" />\n</a>\n<a href={wslmesheryloginsuccess}>\n    <img src={wslmesheryloginsuccess} alt=\"wslmesheryloginsuccess\" />\n</a>\n\n\n#### [Optional] More analytics with Grafana\nAs stated above, Meshery can leverage the analytics provided by Grafana. For this blog post, as everything is built from scratch. Here is the setup for a new Grafana dockerized instance.\n\nStart a new Grafana on docker instance\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n-d \\\n-p 3000:3000 \\\n--name=grafana \\\n-e \"GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL=http://$mainIP\" \\\n-e \"GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=MesheryInstance\" \\\ngrafana/grafana\n```\n\n<a href={wslgrafanastart}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanastart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanastart\" />\n</a>\n\n- Access the new instance with the admin password that you set in the docker environment variable\n```bash\n$BROWSER $mainIP:3000 &\n```\n\n<a href={wslgrafanalogin}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanalogin} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanalogin\" />\n</a>\n<br />\n<a href={wslgrafanaloginsuccess}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanaloginsuccess} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanaloginsuccess\" />\n</a>\n\n### An inside look\nWhile everything should run fine, it's always good to have a look at what has been deployed.\n\nIn this case, we are almost exclusively working with Docker and the \"inside look\" should look something like this:\n\n<a href={wslmesherycomplete}>\n    <img src={wslmesherycomplete}className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslmesherycomplete\" />\n</a>\n\n#### Conclusion\nAs [Lee Calcote](https://twitter.com/lcalcote) put it, this is a lot of buzz words: Meshery > k3s (deployed via k3d) > Docker > WSL2 > Windows 10. And he's totally right, still the \"beauty\" here, is that it \"simply works\".\n\nSince the begin of the Docker era, new tooling has appeard for simplifying complex workflows.\nEven Kubernetes (K8s) as a much lighter version with k3s by Rancher.\n\nAnd of course, Meshery which integrates and simplifies the installation and benchmarking of different service meshes. Hope you had fun assembling all these pieces and stay tunned for the \"Bonuses\", more fun to come!\n\n<span> > > > <i>Nunix out</i></span>\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Getting started with Meshery, WSL2 and k3d","subtitle":"","date":"July 9th, 2019","author":"Nuno do Carmo","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrgAAABXRUJQVlA4IKwAAAAwBQCdASoUABQAPtFgqU+oJSOiKAgBABoJagDHMywTmwXkh8XuWw62pPgeLa6iGOkYAAD+9R4SKH1oL6udrBkwr5rrkLRIeudVijKFQQi4NBpAgn1GqiLKGll7/coQQQ8X2m4ARFICZ1eH4EKwlMH79KOgYAEP9qeZU1fXG+Jmj3mSYoA/SF+9X/WI4UZXzEZSPBXefiBldNQhjxeWdjq9FujdEnATM/mAAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp 400w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/cnab-logo.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrgAAABXRUJQVlA4IKwAAAAwBQCdASoUABQAPtFgqU+oJSOiKAgBABoJagDHMywTmwXkh8XuWw62pPgeLa6iGOkYAAD+9R4SKH1oL6udrBkwr5rrkLRIeudVijKFQQi4NBpAgn1GqiLKGll7/coQQQ8X2m4ARFICZ1eH4EKwlMH79KOgYAEP9qeZU1fXG+Jmj3mSYoA/SF+9X/WI4UZXzEZSPBXefiBldNQhjxeWdjq9FujdEnATM/mAAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/d8057/cnab-logo.webp 100w,\n/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/2e34e/cnab-logo.webp 200w,\n/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/cnab-logo.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/getting-started-with-meshery-wsl2-and-k3d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Meshery"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1376321266","1485533831","2848499768","3205812809","4047814605","961506260"],"matchPath":"/blog/tag/meshery"}
