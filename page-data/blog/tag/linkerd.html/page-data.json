Microservice architectures brought on as many challenges as they have advantages. With operational complexity being one of the most acute pains. Service meshes do offer solutions to a number of these operational concerns. Including but not limited to: resilience, improved observability, security and advanced service discovery.\n<div>\n  <div>\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MXQV-i-Hkf8\" loading=\"lazy\" frameBorder=\"0\"\n    allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n    style={{minHeight: \"315px\", minWidth: \"280px\"}}></iframe>\n</div>\nBut with so many mesh options around - how do we choose, evaluate and compare them? And once we‚Äôve chosen a solution - how do we make it accessible to all our engineers? It is to provide an answer to these questions that the Layer5 community has created <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>, the open-source, service mesh management plane. Meshery already supports a number of leading mesh providers with adapters for additional meshes on the way. In today‚Äôs video, I‚Äôll show how to use Meshery for rolling out and evaluating Linkerd.\n\n Linkerd is a system that comes from the service mesh pioneers - the company called Buoyant. They were the first to realise the need for a distributed network of smart, centrally configured proxies and coin the term ‚Äúservice mesh‚Äù back in 2016. Today, we‚Äôll be looking at Linkerd 2.x - the second generation of this now CNCF project.\n</div>\n<div>\n<h5>Meshery Adapters</h5>\n    <table className=\"table-adapters\">\n        <thead className=\"hidden\">\n            <th>Status</th>\n            <th>Adapter</th>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td rowSpan=\"7\" className=\"stable-adapters\">stable</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-istio\">\n                <img src={istio} alt=\"Istio Service Mesh adapter\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Istio\n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-linkerd\"><img src={linkerd} alt=\"Linkerd\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Linkerd</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-consul\"><img src={consul} alt=\"Consul Connect\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Consul</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-octarine\"><img src={octarine} alt=\"Octarine Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Octarine</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-nsm\"><img src={nsm} alt=\"Network Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Network Service Mesh</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td className=\"stable-adapters\"/></tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td rowSpan=\"2\" className=\"beta-adapters\">beta</td>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-cpx\">\n                <img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQksHj15DkID308qQw3cmkQrRULPxyzbVquSZVev-9dj1L6sPs-rQ&s\" alt=\"Citrix CPX Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Citrix CPX\n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td className=\"beta-adapters\"/></tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td rowSpan=\"6\" className=\"alpha-adapters\">alpha</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-maesh\">\n                <img src={maesh} alt=\"Maesh Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Maesh\n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-app-mesh\">\n                <img src={awsappmesh} alt=\"AWS App Mesh Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for App Mesh \n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-kuma\">\n                <img src={kuma} alt=\"Kuma Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Kuma\n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr><tr>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td className=\"alpha-adapters\"/></tr>\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n</div>\n\nSome things that Linkerd is known for:\n\n<li>Purpose-built for Kubernetes</li>\n<li>Featuring custom-built, highly performant proxies written in Rust</li>\n<li>Zero-config option (works out-of-the-box)</li>\n<li>Network telemetry built-in (includes a pre-configured, optimised Prometheus instance)</li>\n<li>Low-overhead control-plane</li>\n<li>Operational simplicity (when compared to Istio, for example, even though Istio is getting better in this regard)</li>\n\nSo what is covered in the video? More or less the following:\n\n<li>What service mesh tech allows us to do</li>\n<li>What a typical service mesh architecture looks like</li>\n<li>What Layer5 is about (<i>Lookout - it may surprise you!</i> üòØ)</li>\n<li>What Meshery is. What Linkerd is.</li>\n<li>How easy it is to install Meshery on your PC (be it Linux, Mac or Windows)</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\nAll it takes is:\n\n```sh\n$ curl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n```\n\n</li></ul>\n<li>How Meshery connects to your Kubernetes cluster (nothing to be done if it‚Äôs in your <code>kubectl config current-context</code>)</li>\n<li>How to correctly install and remove Linkerd on your Kubernetes cluster using Meshery</li>\n<li>How to install one of included Linkerd sample applications and verify the installation</li>\n\nThat‚Äôs quite a lot of content for a 20 minute clip. In the follow-up videos, we‚Äôll dive deeper into many of these concepts. And also show how to use Meshery with other service mesh providers.\n\nThis video is also the opening shot of Layer5's [Learn to Service Mesh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3A-A6hPO2IN_HSU0pSfijBboiHggs5mC) playlist, which is specifically dedicated to tutorials and webinars. If service mesh tech interests you and you‚Äôre willing to learn more about it, then make sure to [subscribe to the channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFL1af7_wdnhHXL1InzaMvA?sub_confirmation=1) and watch for updates.\n\nAnd let us know if there‚Äôs any specific content you want us to create. Or maybe anything you‚Äôve created yourself and would like to share?
