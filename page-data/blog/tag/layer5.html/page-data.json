And then, üí• a single-click was all it took to kickstart my journey in Open Source and set in-motion a new chapter in my career development and relationships with new colleagues. \nI would say this was my best ever decision in life till now.\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"firs-pr\">Getting started in the community</h2>\n<p>\nDespite the warm welcome that I receive upon joining Layer5's Slack workspace, I was a bit shy to introduce myself in the{\" \"}<a href = \"https://layer5io.slack.com/archives/C019426UBNY\">#newcomers channel</a>, but then I saw so many other folks introducing themselves. My inner voice asked, \"If they can do it, why can't I?\", so I went ahead and introduced myself to the community. \nThe best part for newcomers in Layer5 is that not only is each individual warmly welcomed, but that\nLayer5 {\" \"} <a href = \"https://layer5.io/community/meshmates\">MeshMates</a> and Community Managers host a weekly meeting (see the{\" \"}<a href = \"https://layer5.io/community/calendar\">community calendar</a>) dedicated to the success of newcomers, helping each person find a foothold in the community. The overview provided in each weekly Newcomers meeting gives you the leg up that you need to get started with any of{\" \"} <a href = \"https://layer5.io/projects\">Layer5's projects</a> and orients you to the how the community works (the{\" \"} <a href = \"https://layer5.io/community/handbook\">community handbook</a> is an excellent resource in this regard) and who to contact in your areas of interest.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I highly recommend all newcomers to engage as much as possible in the community. You will gradually start seeing a change in yourself.\n</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"first-pr\">Way to my First Pull Request üèÅ</h3>\n<p>\nI still remember at that time I was just a beginner with Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and most of the issues on the repository were going over my head. \nSo I started with a very beginner-friendly issue about changing a background of a component and who would have thought this changing background issue will eventually change my life in open source. \nThen I made my first ever pull request in Layer5 and that got merged!\n</p>\n<p>\nTry out some good first issues here{\"\"} <a href = \"https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22\">Layer5</a> {\"\"} ,<a href = \"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22\">Meshery</a>üíª\n</p>\n<h3 id=\"more-prs\">From 1 Pull Request to 90+ Pull Requests Merged üöÄ</h3>\n<p>\n After my first pull request got merged I really got pumped up with joy and told myself that I can do more. This journey of learning and pull requests was not at all easy for me, it took almost 9 months of continuous dedication and effort. There are many great folks I met here in the community, who helped me and taught me new interesting concepts. \n A big thanks to all of them, this was not possible without their guidance and support.\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"learnings-at-Layer5\">Things I learned at Layer5</h2>\n<p>\n   There are a variety of things I learned at Layer5 and a lot I'm learning currently. I gained much technical knowledge as well as soft skills in these 9 months. I spend most of my time working on the UI of Meshery and its various projects. \n   In terms of technical items I learned React, Docker, Kubernetes, new JavaScript concepts, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n  I would say Layer5 is the best in terms of work ethics, community management, a healthy work environment, and a lot more. \n  You can gain real-life working experience on such big projects and guidance related to your career.\n</p>\n<h2 id=\"learnings-at-Layer5\">How I landed an internship at Layer5?</h2>\n<p>\n  I gradually started learning about the project and made myself choose one area to start with and continued to explore further. I kept pushing myself with patience until I feel strong and capable enough to\n  take responsibilities and give my best to the community, Then I asked and applied for an internship and eventually, I got selected.\n</p>\n<p>Now I can make more impact and grow more under the right guidance.üòÉ</p>\n<h2 id=\"apart-from-coding\">Apart from coding</h2>\n<p>\n  Besides coding at Layer5, I made many new friends, great experiences, and memories.\n</p>\n<p>\n  At last, I would say, join this amazing community and experience the change in yourself. This will open the doors for opportunities for you. Just be tenacious and push yourself, that's all that I did.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Thank you\n</p>\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My Open Source Journey @Layer5","subtitle":"From Contributor to SWE Intern","date":"January 14th, 2022","author":"Gaurav Chadha","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRvAAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSDIAAAABR6CYkSQ4OofDzP4WY3E2IuIv5XgJNQGQMDEoQABDGMYiqzic3hH9n4A5CaP+00akJFZQOCCYAAAAsAQAnQEqFAAUAD7RWKRNKCUjoigNUQAaCWMAyy2MJnC7U+9Q9E5b6XMO9ZlQgAD+1z/pzRrTxe2FqdXqL/cH61jTwYn3kNhdWQA5YLWcimjwOnzhyInI0o8dTEEIHjLH94YG+hwkgwkLIuOXyPQhBcjWT8lN1klbFlAnnTuD5Ql61EvQ+OBRh9lM0eCW2F831IpGAun1FAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/5bc28/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/4f03f/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 750w,\n/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/4f506/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 1080w,\n/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/5bc28/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 1216w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/Gaurav Chadha - Layer5 Intern.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRvAAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAAEwAAQUxQSDIAAAABR6CYkSQ4OofDzP4WY3E2IuIv5XgJNQGQMDEoQABDGMYiqzic3hH9n4A5CaP+00akJFZQOCCYAAAAsAQAnQEqFAAUAD7RWKRNKCUjoigNUQAaCWMAyy2MJnC7U+9Q9E5b6XMO9ZlQgAD+1z/pzRrTxe2FqdXqL/cH61jTwYn3kNhdWQA5YLWcimjwOnzhyInI0o8dTEEIHjLH94YG+hwkgwkLIuOXyPQhBcjWT8lN1klbFlAnnTuD5Ql61EvQ+OBRh9lM0eCW2F831IpGAun1FAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/5f169/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/d66e1/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 125w,\n/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/e7160/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 250w,\n/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/5f169/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 500w,\n/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/3cd29/Gaurav%20Chadha%20-%20Layer5%20Intern.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/147eb42e679d9d748e0e6ff68f44fb6e/Gaurav Chadha - Layer5 Intern.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/my-open-source-journey-layer5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"tag":"Layer5"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1376321266","1485533831","2848499768","3205812809","4047814605","961506260"],"matchPath":"/blog/tag/layer5"}
