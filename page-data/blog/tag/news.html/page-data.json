Extension points allow you to  augment the behavior of Meshery by either adding entirely new capabilities or affecting the behavior of existing functionality, as see in the figure below.\n\n<div className=\"img-center\">\n  <a href={MesheryExtensibility} style={{backgroundColor: \"rgba(255,255,255,0)\"}}><img src={MesheryExtensibility} /></a>\n</div>\n\nAs you can see in the diagram, Meshery offers many types of extension points.\n\n- <strong>Extensible Service Mesh Adapters</strong> - bring your own service mesh.\n- <strong>Extensible APIs</strong> - bring your own GraphQL resolvers and expose new, custom endpoints.\n- <strong>Extensible Load Generators</strong> - Meshery supports three types of load generators, however, you can bring your own and plug it in.\n- <strong>Extensible Providers</strong> - the v0.5.0 release delivers dynamic injection of Remote Provider extensions. Providers are a powerful mechanism for integrating Meshery into your existing tooling and systems.\n\nThere are two types of Providers in Meshery: Local - built into Meshery and Remote - implemented by anyone or any organization that wishes to integrate with Meshery. Remote Provider extensibility includes:\n\n  * Pluggable UI functionality\n  * Pluggable Backend functionality\n  * Pluggable Authentication and Authorization\n  * Long-Term Persistence\n  * Enhanced Visualization\n  * Historical Reporting  \n\nLearn more about the platform Meshery provides to extend its funcionality by exploring its <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility\">extension points</Link>. If you have or are building your own <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility/providers\">Remote Provider</Link>, let us know!\n<h2>MeshKit and Meshery Adapter Library</h2>\n\nAs a service mesh toolkit, MeshKit aims to specifically focus on service mesh management and provides broadly useful functionality, it provides a standard policy for error handling and logging across all Meshery components, and implementations for error handling, logging, and tracing.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>MeshKit provides common data models of Service Mesh Interface conformance testing for Meshery.</li>\n  <li>The low-level API abstract by MeshKit to the high-level functions provides out-of-the-box functions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Meshery Adapter Library</h3>\n\n<p>The Meshery Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of functionality for managing the lifecycle of service meshes and their workloads.</p>\n<div className=\"img-center\">\n  <a href={MesheryAdapterLibrary}><img src={MesheryAdapterLibrary} /></a>\n</div>\n\n* The library provides a set of interfaces, some with default implementations like a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh-specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.\n* The default configuration provider we use Viper to reads the adapter specific configuration, and the configuration providers are implementations of an interface, this can be flexible if anyone wants to implement it on their own.\n\n<div className=\"intro\" style={{textAlign: \"center\", margin: \"2rem 4rem\"}}><p>Read <Link to=\"/community/members/michael-gfeller\">Maintainer Michael Gfeller</Link>'s blog post <Link to=\"/blog/meshery/introducing-meshkit-and-the-meshery-adapter-library\">Introduction MeshKit and the Meshery Adapter Library</Link> for more details.</p></div>\n\nWith the increasing the number and diversity of service meshes supported by Meshery, you might find the list of [Supported Service Meshes](https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes) a helpful, complete list.\n\n<h2>Meshery Operator</h2>\n<img style={{float: \"left\", maxWidth: \"300px\", width: \"20%\", padding: \"1.25rem\"}} src={MesheryOperator} />\n<p style={{display: \"block\", width: \"100%\"}}>\nAs a Kubernetes custom controller, Meshery Operator provides a Kubernetes-native approach to interfacing with Meshery. Kubernetes is where service meshes have gotten their initial foothold, and therefore, important that Meshery interface to Kubernetes natively.\n</p>\n<p>Some service meshes support non-containerized workloads outside of the cluster and will grow in this focus over time. While Meshery Operator is Kubernetes only in the v0.5.0 release, Meshery's arichitecture makes considerations for different workload and platform types.</p>\n\n<div style={{display: \"flex\", width: \"100%\"}}>\n  <div style={{textAlign: \"center\", flex: \"50%\"}}>\n    <a href={MesheryOperatorShot} style={{backgroundColor: \"rgba(255,255,255,0)\"}}><img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={MesheryOperatorShot} /></a>\n  </div>\n  <ul style={{flex: \"50%\"}}>\n    <li>Meshery Operator is the multi-service mesh operator that runs as a Kubernetes Operator and defines two custom resources: MeshSync and Meshery Broker (NATS)</li>\n    <li>Meshery Operator is provides abilities includes cluster discovery, service mesh discovery, and data streaming via NATS.</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3>MeshSync</h3>\n<p>MeshSync is available as a Kubernetes custom resource that provides tiered discovery and continual synchronization with Meshery Server as to the state of the Kubernetes cluster, service meshes, and their workloads.</p>\n\n<div style={{display: \"flex\"}}>\n<img style={{maxWidth: \"300px\", width: \"20%\", padding: \"1.25rem\"}} src={MeshSync} />\n<ul>\n\n  <li>MeshSync is one of a family of custom controllers within Meshery Operator and is the <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/meshsync\">heartbeat of Meshery</Link>, pumping information about service meshes and their workloads throughout Meshery's components.</li>\n  <li>MeshSync helps Meshery mesh with meshes by helping define a service mesh agnostic object model.</li>\n  <li>It provides ability to detect service meshes and services deployed on the cluster, and snapshot stored in-memory and refreshed periodically; \nmaintain the local snapshot of the cluster and refreshed periodically.</li>\n  <li>MeshSync These abilities above help Meshery operations more resilient.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n<h4>Relational Database</h4>\n\nMeshery's <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/database\">relational database</a> serves as a repository for MeshSync data, user preferences, and system settings. This database should be considered ephemeral and given that it operates as a cache. Meshery relational database offers federated datasets for managing multiple Kubernetes cluster and multiple service meshes.\n\n<div className=\"img-center\">\n  <a href={MesheryDB}><img src={MesheryDB} /></a>\n</div>\n\n<p>Learn more and consider <a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshsync\">contributing</a> to MeshSync.</p>\n\n## GraphQL Support\n\nMeshery now supports <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture#meshery-operator-and-meshsync\">GraphQL instances</a> between Meshery UI and Meshery Server offering any GraphQL client the  power to ask for exactly what they need from mesh. This new API sets the stage preparing for  exciting features in upcoming releases. Extension points are also built into Meshery's GraphQL support allowing integrators to bring their own GraphQL resolvers to the Meshery server runtime.\n\n\n<h2>Meshery Command Line Interface Enhancements</h2>\nThe beloved `mesheryctl` introduces new commands in the v0.5.0 release expands the CLI's support of multiple Meshery deployments with the `context` command and control over when Meshery auto-updates with the `channel` command.\n\n<h3>Managing Multiple Meshery Deployments</h3>\nIntroduced in this release is the meshconfig - a configuration file that describes Meshery deployments in separate <i>contexts</i>. A Meshery <i>context</i> describes deployments across Docker hosts and Kubernetes clusters. <code>mesheryctl system context</code> enables user to easy manage multiple deployments of Meshery by quickly switching contexts. \n\n### Subscribing to Meshery Release Channels\n`mesheryctl system channel` allows you to easily set and switch between which Meshery release channel (stable or edge) that you want a particilar Meshery deployment (`context`) to use. Meshery deployments subscribe to one of two release channels and can either automatically self-update the deployment or prompt you to update the deployment. Alternatively, you can pin a given Meshery deployment to a specific release should you want tighter control over when Meshery updates. Read more about <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/build-and-release#release-channels\">Meshery's <i>stable</i> and <i>edge</i> release channels</Link>. \n\n\nReview the <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl\">mesheryctl Command Reference</Link> for details on all subcommands, flags, and their behavior.\n\n<h2>On to v0.6.0</h2>\n\nTo get a more comprehensive list of the bug fixes and enhancements packaged in the v0.5.0 release, see the [Meshery Documentation](https://docs.meshery.io/).

Being fairly new\n    to the world of open source and looking for new communities and technology to\n    delve into, I hopped onto the Layer5 bandwagon and was amazed by the warm\n    welcome I received from the wholesome community. I had done video animation\n    jobs on a small scale before, which is what led me to confidently take up the\n    task of creating a short intro jingle for the various community meetings\n    hosted on the Layer5 youtube channel. After iterating for about a week, I\n    finally came up with something worthwhile. And to my elation, it was accepted!\n    It still warms my heart to see the intro flash before every meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Next up I started work on a next generation model of the layer5.io site. Being\n    a new project based on Gatsby and heavily relying on React, Javascript and\n    GraphQL, the site project was a perfect and challenging opportunity for me to\n    expand on my skill set. Speed learning my way through Gatsby, with a\n    continuous influx of help and helpful suggestions from my MeshMate, Kush\n    Trivedi and others within the community, I soon mastered the platform and have\n    spent weeks on creating countless issues and PRs in hopes of achieving the\n    project goals. A few months down the line, I started reviewing PRs and began\n    helping others contribute, something which I had never had the opportunity to\n    do before! After months of continuous effort, I am proud to write that I\n    recently joined as a maintainer on the project and was soon approached to be a\n    MeshMate, which I happily accepted. My learning graph has seen a soaring\n    positive tangent in the months I have been at Layer5 and I’m looking forward\n    to an even more educative and rewarding journey ahead 😊\n  </p>\n  <br />\n  <h4>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/kelechi-nwachukwu\">\n      Kelechi Precious Nwachukwu\n    </Link>\n  </h4>\n  <img\n    src={ Kelechi }\n    className=\"image-right\"\n    alt=\"kelechi-precious\"\n  />\n  <p>\n    It was the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and being unproductive wasn't\n    something I can stomach. Wanting to expand on my technical domain knowledge, I\n    stumbled across an open-source challenge for women in tech with lists of\n    projects to contribute to by the Women of Open Source Community Africa\n    (WOSCA). My eyes landed on Layer5 and I haven’t looked back since.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A quick look through the repositories left me quaking in my boots. To give you\n    some much needed context and to give some hope to all the newbies out there, I\n    recently transitioned to working in technical domains from accounting and\n    managing construction site projects. Forever getting stuck trying to get my\n    hands on new tech and trying to find a way into the bewildering and humongous\n    tech domains , I didn't even understand some of the jargon, and was too\n    ashamed to ask questions. Stumbling through my first contribution, I somehow\n    made it to the finish line and to my happiness, was soon assigned another\n    task. Instead of complaining, I set out to study up on the issue and took a\n    peek at the other assignees in the repository to ensure that I was not the\n    only one taking inordinate amounts of time on an issue. To my surprise, I was\n    not.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    I got working on the assignment and soon encountered issues that would\n    previously have made me quit. Thankfully, I decided to take a different\n    approach this time. I shared my challenge with the Layer5 community, and was\n    amazed at the immediate and abundant response I received. Since then, I have\n    helped other contributors get through their challenges, and have received an\n    invitation to join the organization as a member, and then as a MeshMate 😎 I\n    have been wholly satisfied with the learning opportunities and the friendly\n    environment that the Layer5 community has to offer. I have learned that I may\n    not be perfect, but by making full use of the resources provided to me, having\n    a supportive community by my side and by being open to learning and showing\n    determined courage in the face of difficulties, I can achieve anything!\n  </p>\n  <h4>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/ruth-ikegah\"> Ruth Ikegah </Link>\n  </h4>\n  <img\n    src={ Ruth }\n    className=\"image-right\"\n    alt=\"ruth-ikegah\"\n  />\n  <p>\n    The field of open source had always been intriguing to me. The idea of a\n    close-knit community working with an aim had me wanting to contribute myself.\n    Considering the fact that I have a small skill set (Donned the coder hat only\n    6 months ago), Layer5 was a great community for me to start out with. I came\n    to know about the Layer5 community from the She Code Africa slack channel,\n    after which I visited the <Link to=\"https://github.com/layer5io\">GitHub repository</Link> and hopped on to the Layer5 slack channel.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    To my good luck, I received a warm welcome from the community and was able to attend a community meeting the day I joined. I made my way through the Github repos and stumbled across a beginner friendly issue. I started work but to my dismay, my PR failed to pass the DCO check at the final rung. Stuck and with low spirits, I talked to Lee (Layer5 Maintainer) and related my problems with the DCO check fail. He patiently assured me that first-time checks can be hard to get right and assigned me a MeshMate, Ashis Singh (read saviour 😳). I sent a message to Ashis and told him about the issues I was having in submitting my Pull Request. He led me through a step by step tutorial on committing and signing off my changes, after which my first PR passed all the checks. I was thrilled at this point, waiting for my PR to be merged. I soon received two emails, the first relaying that my PR had been merged and a few pull requests later, a second one with an invitation to join the Layer5 organization on Github.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Impressed by the process and being passionate about helping others, I soon\n    began helping out with welcoming newcomers in the Layer5 Community and a happy two months later, I am elated to write that I have helped and held the hand of many-a contributors into Open-Source, offering them the same warm welcome that I had received. I was soon promoted to become a MeshMate. Apart from adding another feather to my cap, this also helped me enhance my own skill set and reach in a dozen different directions.The most intriguing fact about the Layer5 community is how welcoming it is. You can contribute something, even as a beginner, no matter how small your skillset is. I have been through the same journey and I recommend it to everyone reading. Experience an open-source community with Layer5 today! Once you’re set up on Slack, do send me a ping to\n    say hi. The exciting part, we might even meet as MeshMates 😉\n  </p>\n\n  \\- Tanuj, Ruth, and Kelechi\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing a new line of MeshMates","subtitle":null,"date":"September 25th, 2020","author":"Our MeshMates with 🤍","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsQAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSBIAAAABD/D5/4iIIBBI2t98goj+RzxWUDggjAAAADAEAJ0BKhQADQA+0VSkS6gko6GwCAEAGglmALsAIeAs4yLj2ZvcYlj7AAD+8ipNYFLcPFqHT1eYGDWdbvsC9m9jlOUn318vJQJCfVdIx/lCmDiy//hGBYHfqa/bUAwSV/VFKhAxNUpsy8CPAYGXQIQGrPPnAYpjnVQWB/icfDL/mPvzHvOUT8bQAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp","srcSet":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/c2fca/meshmate-announcement.webp 750w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/9acda/meshmate-announcement.webp 1080w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/238d8/meshmate-announcement.webp 1366w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp 1500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6733333333333333}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/meshmate-announcement.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsQAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSBIAAAABD/D5/4iIIBBI2t98goj+RzxWUDggjAAAADAEAJ0BKhQADQA+0VSkS6gko6GwCAEAGglmALsAIeAs4yLj2ZvcYlj7AAD+8ipNYFLcPFqHT1eYGDWdbvsC9m9jlOUn318vJQJCfVdIx/lCmDiy//hGBYHfqa/bUAwSV/VFKhAxNUpsy8CPAYGXQIQGrPPnAYpjnVQWB/icfDL/mPvzHvOUT8bQAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/5af24/meshmate-announcement.webp","srcSet":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/a16f1/meshmate-announcement.webp 125w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/fcddb/meshmate-announcement.webp 250w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/5af24/meshmate-announcement.webp 500w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/87c93/meshmate-announcement.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":337}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/meshmate-announcement.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/announcements/announcing-a-new-line-of-meshmates"}},{"id":"ea2400da-2d3b-59c7-be79-7831ba9fc7fc","body":"\n\nimport operator from \"./meshery-operator-dark.svg\";\nimport MesheryArchitecture from \"./meshery-architecture.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n[Meshery](https://meshery.io) is the cloud native management plane offering lifecycle, configuration and performance management of service meshes and their workloads.\n\nLayer5 community members are hard at work providing our users with easy access to any service mesh and myriad management features. New releases for Meshery are published on a frequent cadence with new features and bug fixes. Today, we are announcing version 0.4.0 of Meshery. This summary highlights Meshery's latest developments and elucidates new features.\n\n## What's New?\n\nThe v0.4.0 release of Meshery introduces a plethora of new features and bug fixes across service mesh environments spanning Meshery and it's various adapters.\n\n### Meshery's CLI: `mesheryctl`\n**New Command Structure**<br/>\n`mesheryctl` commands and subcommands have been restructured in v0.4.0 into the categories:\n- Global Commands and Flags\n- Meshery Lifecycle Management\n- Performance Management\n- Service Mesh Lifecycle Management\n- Workload Lifecycle Management\n\nOrganizing commnands [under these categories](https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl) is done with both the intention to make `mesheryctl` functions intuitively at your fingertips, but also to make room for forthcoming functionality.\n\n**Exposing Performance Management in the CLI**<br/>\n`perf:` a new `mesheryctl`command. Introduction of new performance sub-commands, now benchmark your service mesh at the tip of your fingers using our new CLI command `perf`.\n\n**Support for Scoop** <br/>\nSupport extended to Scoop Bucket. You can now install mesheryctl on your Windows machine with Scoop Bucket. Visit the [Meshery Scoop Bucket](https://github.com/layer5io/scoop-bucket) to install Meshery on Windows.\n\n**Rename `cleanup` to `reset`**<br/>\nThe `cleanup` is used to reset your Meshery deployment configuration back to its default settings. This command has been renamed to `reset` to more appropriately reflect its purpose.\n\n### MeshSync<br/>\n<img src={operator} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"meshery-operator-dark\" />\n\n-  A component of the [Meshery Operator](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-operator), MeshSync can scan the environment to get the deployment details of specific types of service meshes and the connected Kubernetes cluster.\n-  MeshSync is a new component addition to Meshery. Meshery needs to be constantly updated given that service meshes and their underlying infrastructure are dynamic, constantly changing.  Meshery operations should be resilient in the face of this change.\n-  MeshSync brings a service mesh agnostic object model that defines relationships between all objects under management.\n\n### Meshery Adapter for Citrix Service Mesh (beta)<br/>\n\n<img src={MesheryArchitecture} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"meshery-architecture\" />\n\n- [Citrix Service Mesh](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-cpx) is now a supported service mesh. Meshery incorporates support for the Citrix ADC CPX, which is a cloud-ready, container-based application delivery controller that can be provisioned on a Docker host.\n- CPX runs as the Istio Data Plane component, displacing Envoy as the default data plane service proxy.<br/>\n\n### Security & Authentication\n\n- Meshery has moved from using session authentication to JWT authentication. Meshery's JWT authentication is powered by Hydra Auth.\n- You can now opt to authenticate yourself on mesheryctl while performing performance tests using `mesheryctl`, you can authenticate yourself by getting the JWT Token from Meshery UI.\n\n### Meshery Server\n\n- Support provided for [wrk2 as an alternative load generator](https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management#load-generators).\n- [Providers](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility) - A new project construct that allows users to select authentication, long-term storage etc.\n- Ad-hoc [connectivity tests for Prometheus and Grafana](https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management#grafana-and-meshery) are now supported.\n- Extraneous information beyond IP address and port in Grafana and Prometheus endpoints have been stripped off.\n\n### Meshery UI\n\n- ES-Lint has been added to the client side to ensure the quality of code and increase maintainaiblity of code.\n- Cypress has been set-up to enable end-to-end tests and integration tests for Meshery UI.\n\n<center><iframe frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowFullScreen={true} mozallowFullScreen=\"true\" webkitallowFullScreen=\"true\"frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowFullScreen={true} mozallowFullScreen=\"true\" webkitallowFullScreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds9D2KgZKxo\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></center>\n\n\n### Other notable changes\n\n- From within the [Meshery Continuous Integration Working Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds9D2KgZKxo&list=PL3A-A6hPO2IM7rYiKxG4l3eQNc6X3IUex), we have strengthened our continuous integration (CI) actions & tests by introducing new workflows like `static check`, `vet check`, `security check` for our server code.\n- ReleaseDrafter & WelcomeBot has been added to the repository to enable automation of release notes and for welcoming new contributors, respectively.\n\nTo get a more comprehensive list of the bug fixes and enhancements packaged in the v0.4.0 release, see the [Meshery Documentation](https://docs.meshery.io/project/releases)\n\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing Meshery v0.4.0","subtitle":"","date":"August 7th, 2020","author":"Layer5 Team","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsoAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSGYAAAABgCsAgIHqqtHm5JrcZNvWxqvd2GwbYz1u7yf5ARGR4N+JIZRCqIZQBSQ+aIdJPY+dC3seH6nRZlTtfN27zv5n8B0Vs5jm+2qmdSqD7LBa0lUQRfBdDgvPIlGJVCQJR0JTiTjw/wBWUDggPgAAADADAJ0BKhQADQA+0VakS6gko6GwCAEAGglpAAB60b/b/AAA/vAi9+Ax+ANYXYVXicTSFmjmW1J3l211gAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp","srcSet":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp 500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.666}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/meshery-v040.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsoAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSGYAAAABgCsAgIHqqtHm5JrcZNvWxqvd2GwbYz1u7yf5ARGR4N+JIZRCqIZQBSQ+aIdJPY+dC3seH6nRZlTtfN27zv5n8B0Vs5jm+2qmdSqD7LBa0lUQRfBdDgvPIlGJVCQJR0JTiTjw/wBWUDggPgAAADADAJ0BKhQADQA+0VakS6gko6GwCAEAGglpAAB60b/b/AAA/vAi9+Ax+ANYXYVXicTSFmjmW1J3l211gAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp","srcSet":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/b6c82/meshery-v040.webp 125w,\n/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/48571/meshery-v040.webp 250w,\n/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp 500w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":333}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/meshery-v040.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/announcements/announcing-meshery-v040"}},{"id":"fbc0a4e6-e2df-5139-835a-843d390eaa13","body":"\n\nimport SmiLogo from \"./smi-logo.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img className=\"image-left\" src={SmiLogo} alt=\"SMI Logo\"/>\n\nMost began their cloud native journey with their first step being use of containers, and taking a second step, moved into container orchestration as their workloads grew. Now, waves and waves of organizations are considering service meshes as their third significant step in their cloud native journey. As they invest into service meshes as their next layer of key infrastructure, users will continue to look for the same assurances sought from other commonly accepted (standard) interfaces for container runtimes (e.g. CRI), container storage (e.g. CSI), container networking (e.g. CNI) and they will look for a commonly accepted service mesh interface.\n\nAs a prominent supporter of management software for multiple service meshes, Layer5 is pleased to partner with Microsoft in support of the [Service Mesh Interface](https://smi-spec.io) (SMI). The Service Mesh Interface is a specification for service meshes that run on Kubernetes. As such, SMI defines a common standard that can be implemented by a variety of service mesh projects and vendors.\n\nLike standards before SMI, consistent APIs inspire confidence in infrastructure stability, community-managed APIs assuage technology and vendor lock-in concerns, and steward the resounding of core use cases, resulting in streamlining the smaller, but critical-to-users, subset of capabilities offered across the [service mesh landscape](https://layer5.io/landscape).\n\nMeshery and SMI are aligned on common goals of getting users started quickly, understanding that users want service mesh technology, but have questions as to which service mesh use, how, and when to get started through a common interface. Meshery’s playground capabilities quick provision a variety of service meshes and reduce time to value and time to understanding for those adopting a service mesh.\n\nAs a multi-mesh manager, Meshery, understands that each service mesh has it own strengths. SMI intends to allow for differentiation by service mesh providers, at the same time providing interoperability between service meshes and their surrounding tooling. As a management plane, Meshery enhances networking intelligence in a multi-mesh way, encouraging users to expect more from their infrastructure. Meshery exposes each service mesh’s differentiated capabilities.\n\nSMI’s aim for consistent APIs facilitates Meshery’s same goals, allowing for users and tools to flourish. As SMI unveils today, so does Meshery’s compatibility.
