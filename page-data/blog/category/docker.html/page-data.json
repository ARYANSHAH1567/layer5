And the answer is Yes because developers need service mesh because of the changing reliability patterns implementation rapidly, it provides a tight feedback loop for developing and deploying workloads onto your service mesh and makes the over developer experience smooth. With the help of service, mesh developers should be able to create environments without needing to be operational experts.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    <h3>Meshery Extension offers an easy single click button to go from Docker Compose to Kubernetes wih all cloud native infrastructure supported.</h3>\n<img src={DDE} alt=\"Docker Desktop Extension Meshery\" style={{width: \"50%\", float: \"right\"}} />\n</p>\n<p>\n    The Docker Extension for Meshery provides:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kubernetes support for your Docker Compose apps - Import your Docker Compose apps.

Collaborate with other engineers in real-time as you use MeshMap to design, deploy, and manage your Kubernetes-based deployments. Save time and use a design template. Take advantage of the best practices embedded in the patterns found in Meshery Catalog. MeshMap not only allows you to create and verify your cloud native application and infrastructure configurations, but to deploy and operate that infrastructure as well.\n\n    Lee demonstrated MeshMap <strong>Designer</strong>  design capabilities using Consul Service Mesh as an eample and configures various Consul-specific features. He designs a service mesh deployment with application and Envoy filter from scratch. \n</p>\n       <p>\n       <img src={visualizer} alt=\"MeshMap Designer\" style={{width: \"50%\", float: \"left\", paddingRight: \"30px\"}} />\n     MeshMap <strong>Visualizer Mode</strong> allows you to examines a visual topology of Kubernetes cluster and its services. View and search log streams from your pod's containers. Connect an interactive terminal to instances of your containers.\n       </p>\n\n<p>\n    To Lee's demo, Nic also added in the context of developer experience that MeshMap also makes it easy to do the job and with Meshery extension it makes it super easy to write and configure code without being worried for the developer environment.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n       These Docker Extensions are so powerful that it allows you to do multiple tasks without leaving Docker Desktop. \n        </p>\n\n<div className=\"iframe-container\">\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3DPZafR8VWM\" loading=\"lazy\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen ></iframe>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Lee Calcote and Nic Jackson packed a great deal of information in this talk.
