This allows you to control and restrict permissions for various resources. In this blog post, we will explore the process of binding a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole. We will also discuss how Meshery, a service mesh management tool, can be utilized to streamline the lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters using MeshMap visual diagrams.</p>\n\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2> \n\n<p>Before we delve into the details, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Access to a running Kubernetes cluster.</li> \n  <li><code>kubectl</code>, the Kubernetes command-line tool, installed and configured to communicate with your cluster.</li>\n  <li>Meshery, the cloud native manager, installed and <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">set up</a> on your local machine.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Binding a Kubernetes Service Account with ClusterRole:</h2>\n\n<p>To bind a Service Account with a ClusterRole, follow the steps outlined below:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Service Account</strong></p>\n<p>First, we need to create a Service Account that we will later bind to a ClusterRole. Use the following kubectl command to create a Service Account named <code>my-service-account</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sh kubectl create serviceaccount my-service-account</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Step 2: Create a ClusterRole</strong></p>\n<p>Next, let's create a ClusterRole that defines the desired permissions. You can either create a new ClusterRole or use an existing one. For the purpose of this example, we will create a ClusterRole named <code>my-cluster-role</code> that has read-only access to Pods and Services:</p>\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRole\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster-role\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\"]\n  resources: [\"pods\", \"services\"]\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"]\n```\n<br />\n<p>Save the above YAML definition to a file named <code>clusterrole.yaml</code>, and create the ClusterRole using the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bash kubectl apply -f clusterrole.yaml</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Step 3: Bind the Service Account with ClusterRole</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, we need to bind the Service Account <code>my-service-account</code> with the ClusterRole <code>my-cluster-role</code>. This can be achieved by creating a ClusterRoleBinding. Execute the following command to create the binding:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bash kubectl create clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding --clusterrole=my-cluster-role --serviceaccount=default:my-service-account</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p>The above command creates a ClusterRoleBinding named <code>my-cluster-role-binding</code> that associates the Service Account <code>my-service-account</code> with the ClusterRole <code>my-cluster-role</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Verification:</strong></p>\n<p>To verify the successful binding, you can use the following command to check the ClusterRoleBinding:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bash kubectl describe clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p>You should see the Service Account and ClusterRole information listed under the <code>Subjects</code> and <code>RoleRef</code> sections, respectively.</p>\n\n<h2>Using Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes Cluster Lifecycle Management:</h2>\n<p>Meshery is a powerful service mesh management tool that simplifies the management and operation of service meshes, including <a href=\"https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kubernetes clusters</a>. MeshMap, a visual diagram feature of Meshery, provides a graphical representation of the service mesh components and their interactions.</p>\n\n<p>To utilize Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management, follow these steps:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Install Meshery</strong></p>\n<p>Refer to the official Meshery <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">documentation</a> to install Meshery on your local machine or within your Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Connect to Your Kubernetes Cluster</strong></p>\n<p>Once Meshery is installed, connect it to your Kubernetes cluster by configuring the necessary authentication and connection details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Access MeshMap</strong></p>\n<p>After successfully connecting Meshery to your Kubernetes cluster, you can access MeshMap from the <a href = \"https://playground.meshery.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meshery</a> user interface. MeshMap visually represents the deployed service mesh, including service endpoints, traffic flows, and workload distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Visualize the Kubernetes Cluster with MeshMap</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have accessed Meshery and connected it to your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps to visualize the cluster using MeshMap:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>From the Meshery user interface, navigate to the MeshMap section.</li>\n  <li>Select your connected Kubernetes cluster from the dropdown menu.</li>\n  <li>Click on the \"Generate Map\" button to generate a visual representation of the service mesh components and their interactions within the cluster.</li>\n  <li>Explore the generated MeshMap to gain insights into your Kubernetes cluster's architecture, traffic patterns, and workload distribution.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In this blog post, we have learned how to bind a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole to control access and authorization within a cluster. We have also explored how Meshery and its MeshMap feature can be used for visualizing the service mesh components and their interactions within a Kubernetes cluster. By following these steps, you can effectively manage and monitor your Kubernetes cluster's lifecycle using RBAC and visualization tools.</p>\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"How To Bind Kubernetes Service Account with ClusterRole","subtitle":"A Comprehensive Guide","date":"June 30th, 2023","author":"Layer5 Team","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/bb8ee/blog-post.png","srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/0dee1/blog-post.png 750w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/8beaa/blog-post.png 1080w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/bb8ee/blog-post.png 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/a66aa/blog-post.webp 750w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/65dd5/blog-post.webp 1080w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/edb28/blog-post.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}},"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/blog-post.png"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/86bab/blog-post.png","srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/e1b03/blog-post.png 125w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/81b70/blog-post.png 250w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/86bab/blog-post.png 500w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/8cf60/blog-post.png 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/46142/blog-post.webp 125w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/81c3e/blog-post.webp 250w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/cd07d/blog-post.webp 500w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/bf95e/blog-post.webp 1000w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"}]},"width":500,"height":281}},"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/blog-post.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/how-to-bind-kubernetes-service-account-with-clusterrole"}},{"id":"515bf6db-37bb-5a06-9892-326ee784c2f6","body":"\n\nimport MesheryVersion from \"./meshery-version.png\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<p>\n  Meshery is constantly evolving and improving, with new features and bug fixes being added regularly. To stay up to date with the latest Meshery features and updates, you can switch between different release channels.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Artifacts of the builds for Meshery and its components are published under two different release channels, so that improved controls may be provided to both  Meshery users and Meshery developers. The two release channels are edge and stable release channels. Relative to stable releases, edge releases occur much more frequently. Edge releases are made with each merge to master, unless that merge to master is for a stable release. Stable releases are made with each\n  merge to master when a GitHub release tag is also present in the workflow.\n</p>\n\n<h2> How release channels offer subscription </h2>\n<p>\n  Release Channels offers a subsciption where user can subscribe to a specific  release channel and get notified when a new release is available. This is  useful for users who want to stay up to date with the latest Meshery features, while also also providing flexibility for users who want to stay on a specific version of Meshery.\n  However, this approach can be risky because some updates may introduce bugs or compatibility issues that could break your existing installation. Depending upon your risk aversion and the nature of your deployment environment, having a subscription means that you will automatically receive these updates that you might not be ready incorporate. On the other hand, release channels also offer the ability to pin to a specific release which is a  good thing as it allows users to maintain stability and predictability of their environment by preventing unexpected changes from being introduced into their system. However, doing so cancels out any future subscription-based benefits such as receiving security patches or bug fixes that were added after that version was released.\n\nTherefore, it's important for you to weigh the pros and cons of each option before making decisions on how you want to manage your Meshery deployment. It's recommended you and your organizations have a well-defined upgrade strategy based on testing and validation procedures prior to applying new releases in production environments whether via subscriptions or manual upgrades to ensure that system availability is maintained and risks are minimized.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTo subscribe to a specific release channel or version using mesheryctl you can use \n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set [stable|stable-version|edge|edge-version] </code></pre>\nThis command will update your local Meshery configuration to use the selected channel for future updates. To set the channel to a specific version, replace Version with the desired version number. Example: <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set stable</code> or <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set stable-v0.5.56</code>\n</p>\n<h2> Switching between Release Channels</h2>\n<p>There are two ways to switch between Meshery release channels: using mesheryctl or by editing your meshconfig file. In this blog post, we'll cover both methods.</p>\n\n<h3>What is Meshconfig?</h3>\n<p>\n  Meshconfig is a configuration file that is used to configure Meshery. It is typically located in the <code>~/.meshery/config.yaml</code> directory. It contains information about the current release channel, the version of Meshery that is installed, and other configuration options that are specific to your Meshery installation. \n  Meshconfig is automatically generated when you run Meshery for the first time. It is also automatically updated when you update Meshery\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n<h3>Switching between Meshery release channels using meshconfig file.</h3>\n<p>Open your terminal and confirm that you have mesheryctl installed by running  <code>mesheryctl version</code>. If you don't have mesheryctl installed, you can install it by following the instructions in the  <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl\">Meshery documentation</a>.</p>\n<li>\nCreate new Meshery config.yaml file <pre><code className=\"language=bash\">mesheryctl system context create [context-name]</code></pre>\n</li>\nExample: <br/> <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context create new-context --components meshery-istio meshery-osm meshery-linkerd --platform docker --url http://localhost:9081 --set --yes </code>\n<li> To view the newly created meshery context use <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context view [context-name]</code></pre></li>\n<li>After making these changes, you can switch between different context by using <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context switch</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Switching between Meshery release channels using mesheryctl.</h3>\n<p>mesheryctl is a command-line tool for managing Meshery. You can use it to switch between different release channels. Here's how:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Run the following command to see the current configuration for Meshery:</li>\n<pre>\n<code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context view</code>\n</pre>\n<img src={MesheryVersion} className=\"image-center\"  style={{width: \"50%\"}}></img>\n<p>This will show you the currently channels ,<b>stable</b> or <b>edge</b>, along with the version number and other information.</p>\n<li>Run the following command to switch to a different release channel:</li>\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel switch</code></pre>\nThis command will update your meshconfig file to switch release channel and version of context in focus. To switch the channel to a specific version, replace <b>Version</b> with the desired version number.\n<li> To confirm that the channel has been changed, run the following command again: <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel view</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Conclusion </h2>\n\n<p>\n  Switching between Meshery release channels is a simple and straightforward process. You can do it using mesheryctl or by switching between your meshconfig file. Whether you want stable updates or bleeding-edge features, Meshery has a release channel that suits your needs. Just remember to carefully consider your use case and needs before making any changes to ensure that you have the best Meshery experience.\n</p>\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Changing

expanding its capability to give developers, operators, and\n    security engineers more control over their infrastructure. In this post,\n    we'll take a look behind the scenes at how each component in Meshery's\n    architecture plays a role in the management of many Kubernetes clusters.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n## Philosophy behind Meshery's multi-cluster management approach\n\nWhile designing Meshery for the world of many service meshes, and many Kubernetes clusters, much care has been taken to ensure that Meshery is an <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility\">extensible management platform</a>, ready for handling new types of infrastructure and new use cases rapidly through its plugin model. Under the hood, <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\">Meshery Server</a> acts as a delegator of operations by figuring out which Meshery Adapter registered its capability against the given operation. The operation is then sent to that given component (like one of Meshery’s service mesh adapters,e.g. Istio adapter) via a gRPC call. <img src={CoreArch} alt=\"deploy modal\"  className=\"image-right\" /> When the operation involves a Kubernetes cluster(s), the kubeconfig(s) is sent as a parameter to the RPCs. It is then the job of the handling adapter to respect that and perform the operation across the passed clusters from kubeconfigs as needed. The operations not requiring a kubeconfig are managed through the same RPC, with the only difference being that the handling component would ignore the `kubeconfigs` field altogether making the system work not just for Kubernetes, but for other cloud native use cases. This approach of reusing the same RPC for different types of requests is pretty common and sometimes debatable with the other approach of being strict with the RPCs. This is what makes Meshery completely pluggable and extensible.\n\n## Using multi cluster with Meshery\n\nFrom a client's perspective, there are two uses of the multi context feature in general. While deploying a <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> design or performing any other operation on their cluster(s), selecting any number of Kubernetes contexts will allow them to uniformly and parallely perform the operation across the clusters. And while visualizing the state of their cluster(s), the same context switcher will allow them to filter across the clusters whose view they want to see.\n\nAll cluster specific operations are now applied over a number of clusters uniformly. So if you have 10 clusters to manage and 8 of those start with the exact same set of pods, deployments, service mesh, etc then <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> can help you to apply these operations quickly and easily.\n\nIt is as simple as selecting the specific cluster(s) from the Kubernetes context switcher in the navbar, and then applying whatever operation you wanted to, whether that be deploying a sample app, a service mesh, or a <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> design.\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img src={Switcher} alt=\"context switcher\" className=\"image-center-shadow\" />\n</p>\n\nJust before applying the operation, you will be prompted with a confirmation modal which will provide the information about which cluster(s) that operation will be performed against. As the User interface improves, this same modal will also convey more useful information about the operation they are going to perform.\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img src={Deploy} alt=\"deploy modal\" className=\"image-center-shadow\" />\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n### Using MeshMap visualizer\n\nYou can switch between views of your cluster in visualizer mode while using <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link>.\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img\n    src={Cluster2}\n    alt=\"visualizer showing data of context1\"\n    className=\"slides-right\"\n  />\n</p>\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img\n    src={Cluster1}\n    alt=\"visualizer showing data of context2\"\n    className=\"slides-left\"\n  />\n</p>\n\n### Managing Meshery on multiple clusters\n\nUsers can perform cluster related operations from the settings page like adding more clusters, removing data from existing clusters and removing existing clusters.\n\n<img src={Settings} alt=\"Settings page\" className=\"slides-right\" />\n\nMeshery also deploys Meshery operator across the cluster it’s about to manage. This operator manages the lifecycle of a Meshery broker and MeshSync. MeshSync pumps the blood into Meshery’s core, in other words, it is responsible for watching all different types of resources by establishing a watch stream over each of them. MeshSync then pumps that data into the NATS server, of which Meshery server itself is a client. From there, Meshery server gets all the relevant data related to activities in the cluster.\n\nBy default, <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> wants to be as much aware about your infrastructure as possible to provide value so it deploys its operator across each detected cluster. But you can fine tune this configuration by going over each one of them from the table as shown.\n\n<img\n  src={Cluster}\n  alt=\"Kubernetes multi-cluster management with Meshery\"\n  className=\"image-center-shadow\"\n/>\n\nIf you disconnect your cluster and do not want to persist the data from that cluster then you can perform a fine-grained deletion by deleting all MeshSync data (which are the Kubernetes objects) for that specific cluster.\n\n<img src={Flush} alt=\"flushing MeshSync data\" className=\"image-center-shadow\" />\n## Future of multi-cluster\n\nMeshery as an extension point to your infrastructure provides out-of-the-box value by adding components which can be Kubernetes specific, service mesh specific or custom components to add new functionality. We can now add multi-cluster specific components to provide more abstraction. This model can be used along with Meshery’s multi-mesh capabilities to give an overall multi-mesh multi-cluster experience to the user. For instance, your Istio service mesh spanning across multiple clusters can be abstracted and managed by Meshery using custom components such as VirtualGateway and VirtualDestinationRules. In this case, Meshery’s Istio adapter will handle the logic of converting a VirtualGateway into gateways across the clusters. This abstraction provides high value by powering the service mesh to span across the clusters while the Ops team can configure the mesh with minimal effort.\n\nJust like the example above, many such Meshery extension points are in Meshery to add logic into and add useful functionality. And as more of such extension points are added, Meshery will continue to give more and more power to your cloud native infrastructure.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Management with Meshery","subtitle":"Wrangling your services one cluster at-a-time","date":"July 28th, 2022","author":"Ashish Tiwari","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoAAAABXRUJQVlA4IHQAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwDE2CF54D5t+bwgAP68SM3n4NvbowqxZAxrpC/QYjXpmca9fnDRt2vaA4crmoLs6No+L37Zc43rqKBUXdMCecvSw2drXRb5/RfsD7tY1aZ37HN/ekX7tRAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/c512e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp","srcSet":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/a66aa/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 750w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/65dd5/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1080w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/4fad6/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1366w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/c512e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoAAAABXRUJQVlA4IHQAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwDE2CF54D5t+bwgAP68SM3n4NvbowqxZAxrpC/QYjXpmca9fnDRt2vaA4crmoLs6No+L37Zc43rqKBUXdMCecvSw2drXRb5/RfsD7tY1aZ37HN/ekX7tRAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/cd07d/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp","srcSet":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/46142/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 125w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/81c3e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 250w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/cd07d/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 500w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/bf95e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":281}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery"}},{"id":"0bf099ea-9608-5c18-9882-81c42e07ea75","body":"\n\nimport mesheryui from \"./mesheryui.webp\"; \n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n<p><a href=\"https://meshery.io/\">Meshery</a>'s goal is to make the operation of cloud native infrastructure and the service mesh layer of cloud simplified.

Thus, we, Layer5 have curated the documentation for Meshery to meet such purposes. Not to mention, <code>mesheryctl</code>, the CLI client of Meshery needs a curated documentation as well. This blog describes about the evolution of <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page. </p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Initial Command Reference Design</h3>\n<p>\nThe initial design of <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page is all made using pure markdown and the functionality is handled using Jekyll, the main framework used for Meshery Docs. This handled great at initial stage but had many limitations, such as:\n    <ul>\n        <li>Updation of YAML for data is often required</li>\n        <li>Design was obselete at initial stage</li>\n        <li>No separate pages for each command and subcommand</li>\n    </ul>\n    Thus, the idea for redesigning the <code>mesheryctl</code> reference page was desperately needed.\n    </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\" alt=\"Meshery Documentation\" target=\"_parent\">\n    <img src = {oldDesign} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Initial design of mesheryctl command reference\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>Updated Command Reference Design</h3>\n<p>To tackle the shortcomings of the previous design, I was tasked to redesign the <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page entirely. This was a big task at first glance to me, as I was a new contributor back then. Eventually after manipulating the reference section with help of great folks, I was able to pull off the task and the design was updated. </p> \n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\" alt=\"Meshery Documentation\">\n<img src={newDesign} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Meshery CLI command reference\" /></a>\n</p>\n<p>The redesign work was done with help of HTML in markdown and with optimization in YAML code. A sample is given below.</p>\n\n```\n    <!-- Copy this template to create individual doc pages for each mesheryctl commands -->\n\n    <!-- Name of the command -->\n    # mesheryctl mesh\n\n    <!-- Description of the command. Preferably a paragraph -->\n    ## Description\n\n    {% assign name = site.data.mesheryctlcommands.cmds[page.command] %}\n    {{ name.description }}\n\n    <!-- Basic usage of the command -->\n    <pre className=\"codeblock-pre\">\n    <div className=\"codeblock\">\n    mesheryctl mesh [flags] \n    </div>\n    </pre>\n    ...........\n```\n\n<h3>Adding auto generation feature in reference</h3>\n<p>As time passed, we realized that the command reference missed something for a while, though the design has been changed. Then, we thought the idea of automating the generation of docs such that developers don't need to change the code in docs section while working towards <code>mesheryctl</code>. That's where we got to know that Cobra library (the library for CLI apps made using golang) has a feature to make doc pages automatically. So we decided to incorporate that feature into <code>mesheryctl</code> docs page as well! After making several changes and a PR, I was finally able to introduce the feature in the docs site!</p>\n\n```\nvar startCmd = &cobra.Command {\n\tUse:   \"start\",\n\tShort: \"Start Meshery\",\n\tLong:  `Start Meshery and each of its service mesh components.`,\n\tArgs:  cobra.NoArgs,\n\tExample: `\n// Start meshery\nmesheryctl system start\n// To create a new context for in-cluster Kubernetes deployments and set the new context as your current-context\nmesheryctl system context create k8s -p kubernetes -s\n// (optional) skip checking for new updates available in Meshery.\nmesheryctl system start --skip-update\n// Reset Meshery's configuration file to default settings.\nmesheryctl system start --reset\n// Silently create Meshery's configuration file with default settings\nmesheryctl system start --yes\n.....\n}\n\t`,\n```\n\n<p>Using this information provided above in each golang file, the markdown page is generated using Cobra CLI library and thus reducing the workload on the developer by automating via <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/.github/workflows/mesheryctl-ci.yml#L73\">GitHub Actions</a>.</p>\n<br />\n<p>This is so far on how the <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference is evolved for now. And I hope that it'll continue to evolve in the field of documentation to serve the users to use Meshery in best way possible.</p>\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Evolution of the Meshery CLI Command Reference","subtitle":null,"date":"June 9th, 2022","author":"Aadhitya Amarendiran","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABwBACdASoUAA0APtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJbACdMoGvtgJwx880HleA8ofTgAD+2VgctvGN2cFdfAJj4YJ0Ha8AiiMSiWh82G/yk9ZshKIR54QST0HBPk98AjqzxGHfuVZiMjvT9XDm39S3tEJ+oAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/f06bf/mesheryctl.webp 750w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/8c7d4/mesheryctl.webp 1080w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6316666666666667}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/mesheryctl.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABwBACdASoUAA0APtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJbACdMoGvtgJwx880HleA8ofTgAD+2VgctvGN2cFdfAJj4YJ0Ha8AiiMSiWh82G/yk9ZshKIR54QST0HBPk98AjqzxGHfuVZiMjvT9XDm39S3tEJ+oAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/704ce/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/5a879/mesheryctl.webp 125w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/6d26b/mesheryctl.webp 250w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/704ce/mesheryctl.webp 500w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/5c637/mesheryctl.webp 1000w","sizes":"(min-width: 500px) 500px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":316}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/mesheryctl.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/evolution-of-the-meshery-cli-command-reference"}},{"id":"5d6e85c1-a958-51c5-a20e-1308e5fd0237","body":"\n\n\n\nimport UnitTest from \"./unit-test.webp\";\nimport IntegrationTest from \"./integration-test.webp\";\nimport TreeGraph from \"./tree-graph.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"intro \">\n<p>Delivering a high quality user experience is our pinnacle goal in the design of Meshery's CLI: <code>mesheryctl</code>. Delivering a high quality user experience means testing both qualitatively and quantatively. As a concept, quality - whether you're talking about software or anything else - can be directly measured by consistency. A quality user experience is consistent and consistency of <code>mesheryctl</code> is reinforced by its many unit tests.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><code>mesheryctl</code> is written in Golang. In the Meshery project, we use CodeCov to calculate the code coverage across <code>mesheryctl</code>'s line of code. And there are plenty of lines of code. Achieving high percentages of code coverage in Meshery's CLI with grows in criticality as we bring more features into <code>mesheryctl</code> as a robust and sophisticated command line client of Meshery. Unit and integration tests bolster and roll up into broader end-to-end, functional testing performed across Meshery and the rest of its components. </p>\n\n<p>High levels of code coverage makes it easier for each project contributor to be confident that their code changes aren’t breaking any preexisting <code>mesheryctl</code> commands, side-swiping their functionality unknowingly, and consequently, unwittingly lowering the quality of Meshery's overall user experience.</p>\n\n<h3> mesheryctl lines of code</h3>\n\n\n```yaml\n\n    270 text files.\n    106 unique files.\n    166 files ignored.\n\n    cloc v 1.92  T=0.15 s (692.3 files/s, 110063.3 lines/s)\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Language       files          blank        comment           code\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Go                88           2128           1330          13045\n    YAML              12              0              0            215\n    JSON               4              0              0             42\n    make               1             10              2             31\n    Markdown           1             23              0             27\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    SUM:             106           2161           1332          13360\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n<p>Unit Tests can be written in two ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand\n        <ol>\n            <li>Mock Meshery(backend) response if needed</li>\n            <li>Grab console output</li>\n            <li>Store standard/verified mesheryctl output in a golden file(a text file)</li>\n            <li>Match the stored/expected output with what we grab from the console</li>\n            <li>Cover as many scenarios as possible, test the situations where errors must be thrown</li>\n            <li>This is a standard format, changes can be made accordingly</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> functions\n        <ol>\n            <li>This is the standard testing you may have come across in every project</li>\n            <li>You write one test dedicated to one function covering all possible test-cases, matching expected outputs</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Example tree graph</h3>\n<p>This example of a tree graph (from <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/4823\">meshery/meshery/pull/4823</a>) shows the impact given changes make on the level of code coverage.</p>\n\n<img src={TreeGraph} />\n\n<h3>Integration Tests</h3>\n\n<p>Integrations tests come into view when you cannot mock something easily and when a given behavior is cross-functional / cross-component. Integration tests put more, but not all of the focus validating system behavior and that the system completes all the necessary actions. Take <code>mesheryctl system start</code> for example. This command deploys Meshery, its adapters, and Kubernetes Operator; it starts Meshery. So, you run the command to start Meshery in a GitHub workflow and after running the <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand through the tests and make sure that Meshery actually started. And if the workflow successfully runs the test, then boom!, you aced your integration writing test... errr... test writing.</p>\n\n<p>The integration test writing exam can initially be challenging, but... that’s the fun in it. :) Running tests and making sure a command that is otherwise hard to verify, hard to test, and making it automatic through GH workflows.</p>\n\n<h3>How you can make an impact</h3>\n\n<p>Writing tests and making them work is in itself a tough task to do, so writing one test for a single function counts and makes a big difference over the long term. Don't hesitate. Start writing tests now. A single, new test is worthy of raising a pull request and will get you well on your way to learning much more about Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, and service meshes.</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://codecov.io/gh/meshery/meshery/\">Codecov</a> is used to check code coverage in <code>mesheryctl</code> (login with GitHub to get an in-depth idea of lines-of-code being covered in code coverage).</li>\n    <li>You can check the files on CodeCov’s website to figure out which mesheryctl commands haven’t been covered by existing tests.</li>\n    <li>Guide: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRlFpElRmybJ3WacgPKXgCSiQ2poJl3iCCV1dAalf0k/edit#heading=h.rzpmb66db1sq\">Writing tests for mesheryctl</a>.

Your tests will be executed and used time-and-time again. I can’t explain in words (I don’t have that good of a vocabulary). Your Tests are going to run in each pull request raised against the Meshery project, in each commit someone pushes to a pull request, in every nightly regression test suite, in every release. Just think: if another contributor incidently introduces a defect or doesn't consider for an edge case, and fails to uphold the intended behavior of the code, your tests are going to catch them redhanded. How cool is that?</p>\n\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? Jump in and write a few tests today! When you raise your pull request, label it with <code>area/tests</code> and <code>component/mesheryctl</code> and I'll be there to review!

Architecturally, a service mesh consists of two\n  planes. One of those is the data plane, while the other one is the control\n  plane. A service mesh data plane is the collection of intelligent proxies that\n  operate in unison under the coordination of the control plane. The control\n  plane performs configuration management of these intelligent proxies.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A management plane can do many things. Essentially, a management plane helps\n  you integrate service meshes into your backend systems. A robust management\n  plane allows you to take full advantage of the power of the network while\n  integrating your service delivery processes seamlessly. Your management plane\n  might federate different types of service meshes, help you instigate chaos\n  through controlled experiments, or offer automated traffic splitting in order\n  to execute different styles of canarying of your applications. Your management\n  plane might offer deep insights into the performance of your applications and\n  to the performance of your infrastructure or might deliver a change in\n  management framework.\n</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <img\n    src={MesheryLogo}\n    align=\"center\"\n    alt=\"meshery-logo\"\n    height=\"35rem\"\n    width=\"35rem\"\n    style={{paddingBottom: \"5px\", paddingTop: \"auto\"}}\n  />{\" \"}\n  Meshery\n</h3>\n\n<img\n  src={MeshManager}\n  className=\"slides-left\"\n  align=\"right\"\n  alt=\"mesh-manager\"\n/>\n<p>\n  <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> manages the\n  lifecycle of service meshes.

MeshKit can be considered a derivative of `go-kit` with specific focus on service mesh management.\n\nIn the Meshery v0.5.0 release, MeshKit has been enhanced and expanded substantially. Considering that the MeshKit library provides broadly useful functionality, it is used in a growing number of Meshery components. It is intended to be one of the top level libraries in the Meshery ecosystem. <div className=\"fact\">Meshkit provides functionality useful across all Meshery components.</div>\n\nMeshKit is a toolkit for Layer5’s microservices, and is positioned to become Layer5’s middleware component for Layer5’s microservices, leveraging other libraries like `go-kit/kit`. In complement to functionality provided by a service mesh, its purpose is to provide implementations for common cross-cutting concerns like error handling, logging, and tracing. Uniform error handling and logging across all Meshery components helps to implement efficient tooling for observability, monitoring and troubleshooting. The library provides some common data models for Meshery, notably for <Link to=\"/smi\">Service Mesh Interface conformance testing</Link>, and Kubernetes' `kubeconfig`.\n\nAnother central component in Meshkit is the `utils` package.\n\nThis package provides a Kubernetes and a Helm client that implements functionality based on the Go libraries of these tools. The API exposed by these libraries is quite low-level, and the higher-level functions of the `utils` package simplifies usage of Kubernetes and Helm clients significantly.\nAnother advantage MeshKit that it is not necessary to use the command line versions of these tools, providing a more tailored experience for developers,\nand better logging and error handling integration.\n\n<Link to=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshkit\">MeshKit</Link> is simple and straight\nforward to use, as the following code example illustrates.{\" \"}\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"os\"\n\n\tmeshkitlogger \"github.com/layer5io/meshkit/logger\"\n\tmeshkitkubernetes \"github.com/layer5io/meshkit/utils/kubernetes\"\n\t\"k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// nginx contains the deployment manifest for nginx.\n\tnginx := `apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-deployment\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: nginx:1.14.2\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n`\n\n\t// Create an instance of the meshkit logger handler.\n\tlog, err := meshkitlogger.New(\"ExampleApp\",\n\t\tmeshkitlogger.Options{Format: meshkitlogger.JsonLogFormat, DebugLevel: false})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\tlog.Info(\"successfully instantiated meshkit logger\")\n\n\t// Detect kubeconfig on the local system.\n\tconfig, err := meshkitkubernetes.DetectKubeConfig()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\tlog.Info(config.Host)\n\n\t// Create Kubernetes client set for the detected kubeconfig using the Kubernetes Go client library.\n\tclientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\t// Create an instance of the meshkit Kubernetes client ...\n\tclient, err := meshkitkubernetes.New(clientset, *config)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\t// ... and use it to deploy nginx to the cluster.\n\terr2 := client.ApplyManifest([]byte(nginx), meshkitkubernetes.ApplyOptions{\n\t\tNamespace: \"default\",\n\t\tUpdate:    true,\n\t\tDelete:    false,\n\t})\n\tif err2 != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err2)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\tlog.Info(\"successfully applied the manifest\")\n}\n```\n\n## Meshery Adapters\n\nMeshery adapters are management plane components and manage the lifecycle of service meshes. This includes installation and deletion, configuration, and verification that an installation follows recommended practices. In addition, Meshery adapters can assess to what extent a service mesh complies to the <Link to=\"/blog/announcements/a-standard-interface-for-service-meshes\">Service Mesh Interface standard</Link>. Meshery adapters support management of multiple versions of their respective service mesh and also come bundled with sample applications that can be deployed for easy and quick exploration of service mesh capabilities. <div className=\"fact\">Meshery adapters manage the lifecycle of service meshes.</div>\n\nA Meshery adapter is a gRPC server that exposes the `MeshServiceServer` interface:\n\n```go\n// MeshServiceServer is the server API for MeshService service.\ntype MeshServiceServer interface {\n\tCreateMeshInstance(context.Context, *CreateMeshInstanceRequest) (*CreateMeshInstanceResponse, error)\n\tMeshName(context.Context, *MeshNameRequest) (*MeshNameResponse, error)\n\tApplyOperation(context.Context, *ApplyRuleRequest) (*ApplyRuleResponse, error)\n\tSupportedOperations(context.Context, *SupportedOperationsRequest) (*SupportedOperationsResponse, error)\n\tStreamEvents(*EventsRequest, MeshService_StreamEventsServer) error\n}\n```\n\n- `CreateMeshInstance` sets up the Kubernetes client. It does not, as the name might imply, create an instance of a service mesh.\n- `MeshName` returns the name of the mesh, configured in the adapter.\n- `SupportedOperations` returns all supported operations, configured in the adapter. An operation is e.g. the installation of a service mesh.\n- `ApplyOperation` executes the operation specified in the request. It is one of the supported operations.\n- `StreamEvents` allows sending events from the server to the client.\n\nThis API is one of the extension points of Meshery, making it easy to add support for new service meshes to Meshery. Meshery adapters abstract away differences in installation and configuration of the various service meshes.<div className=\"fact\">Adapters allow Meshery to interface with the different service meshes, exposing their differentiated value to users.</div>\n\nIn general, the various service mesh implementations are installed and configured in their own way. For instance, some service meshes have their own installer, like `istioctl` for Istio, while others use Helm charts, like Consul. One of the purposes of Meshery adapters is to abstract these differences away.\n\n## Meshery Adapter Library\n\nAs can be expected, adapters for the various meshes have a lot of code in common. Initially, this common code was copied from one adapter implementation to the next. The question arose whether common code should be factored out to one or several libraries. After some discussion, the community decided to move some of the more general code to Meshkit, and adapter specific code to a new library.\n\nThus, the Meshery Adapter Library was born.\n\nIt reduces the amount of boilerplate code in the adapters substantially, making adapter code easier to follow. This is especially valuable in an open source community where typically many developers contribute, for varying amounts of time. For the same reasons, it is important such libraries are easily understandable.\n\nAlso, it means new adapters can be implemented quickly, as only configuration and operations that differ between services meshes need to be implemented.\n\n<div className=\"fact\">\n  The Meshery Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of\n  functionality that Meshery adapters use for managing the lifecycle of\n  service meshes and their workloads.\n</div>\n\nThe initial commit was submitted on October 6th, 2020 based on a refactoring effort in the adapter for the Kuma service mesh. Within a few months, several adapters have been refactored or implemented from scratch based on the Meshery Adapter Library.\n\nThe main purpose of the Meshery Adapter Library is to:\n\n- provide a set of interfaces, some with default implementations, to be used and extended by adapters.\n- implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, error handling, and tracing.\n- provide a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.\n\nThe core interface in the library is the adapter `Handler` interface:\n\n```go\n// Interface Handler is extended by adapters, and used in package api/grpc that implements the MeshServiceServer.\ntype Handler interface {\n\t// GetName returns the name of the adapter.\n\tGetName() string\n\t// CreateInstance instantiates clients used in deploying and managing mesh instances, e.g. Kubernetes clients.\n\tCreateInstance([]byte, string, *chan interface{}) error\n\t// ApplyOperation applies an adapter operation. This is adapter specific and needs to be implemented by each adapter.\n\tApplyOperation(context.Context, OperationRequest) error\n\t// ListOperations list all operations an adapter supports.\n\tListOperations() (Operations, error)\n\n\t// Need not implement this method and can be reused\n\tStreamErr(*Event, error) // Streams an error event, e.g. to a channel\n\tStreamInfo(*Event)       // Streams an informational event, e.g. to a channel\n}\n```\n\nIt corresponds closely to the gRPC API discussed above, and indeed these methods are called in the implementation of the `MeshServiceServer` interface. This implementation is also part of the Meshery Adapter Library.\n\nUsing `struct` embedding, an adapter extends the default implementation `Adapter` of the interface `Handler` from the library.\nUsually, it is sufficient that this adapter handler overrides only the `ApplyOperation` function from the default implementation.\n(There, it is a no-op implementation.)\n\nThe figure below illustrates this and the usage of the library in an adapter.\n\n<img\n  src={mesheryAdapterLibrary}\n  className=\"image-center\"\n  alt=\"meshery adapter library\"\n/>\n\nIn the `main` package of the adapter, the default configuration provider `Viper` from the library is instantiated, and reads the adapter specific configuration. This includes a specification of all available operations. As configuration providers are implementations of an interface, you can choose any of the providers from the library, or implement your own.\n\nNext, an instance of the adapter handler is created. Other components, for instance a logger, may be created depending on needs and requirements, which is symbolize by the three dots in the figure.\n\nThe `service` is a struct that holds all the parameters that specify an adapter service, like the port the gRPC server is running on, and the instance of the adapter handler created in a previous step. This struct is passed to the `Start` function from the library. This `Start` function wraps the gRPC server, wiring up all necessary components, and starts the service. The developer does not need to touch any gRPC code.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nExtracting common code from adapters to the two new libraries has proven to be a worthwhile investment. It led to cleaner code as well as cleaner application architecture, shortened implementation time for new adapters considerably, and upleveled the quality of Meshery's adapters through consistency of implementation.\n\n\n<div className=\"intro\"><p>P.S.

As a reliably test tool, Cypress  works with <i>ReactJS</i>, <i>VueJS</i>, <i>AngularJS</i> and so on; it is agnostic of the framework you use. You can write all types of tests: <i>end-to-end</i>, <i>integration</i>, and <i>unit tests</i>.\n\nTests allow you to ensure that the new code do not break the current one. They help you to develop and integrate new features faster and ensure everything will work after including your changes. The more tests you have, the more coverage you will have (and less likelihood of issues in production).\n\n### UI tests in Meshery\n\nMeshery has two web projects:\n\n- <b>provider-ui:</b> A <i>ReactJS</i> app that allows you to select the Provider to be used for Meshery\n- <b>ui:</b> Also a <i>ReactJS</i> app where you can do everything related with Meshery. It is the cloud native management plane.\n\nWe create UI tests for both projects using Cypress. Also, we write two types of UI tests at the moment:\n- <b>Integration:</b> Test a specific functionality without backend communication (mocking requests and responses)\n- <b>End-to-end:</b> Test a whole flow like setting up Linkerd Service Mesh or running a SMI Performance Test sending requests and validating the responses from the back-end\n\n### How to write UI tests for Meshery\n\nIf you are writting your first test, you can read and watch the <b><u><a href=\"https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html\">great getting started</a></u></b> from Cypress blog.\n\nThen, you have to add your test below `\"provider-ui/cypress/integration\"` or `\"ui/cypress/integration\"` folders (do not forget adding <i>_spec</i> in the filename).\n\nHere is a basic example of a test validating that <b>Provider UI component</b> exists:\n\n```\ndescribe('Provider UI', () => {\n  it('renders provider component', () => {\n    cy\n      .get('[data-cy=root]')\n      .should('exist')\n  })\n})\n```\n\nPlease follow the <b><u><a href=\"https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html\">best practices recommended</a></u></b> by Cypress.\nOne of the most important is to use or add the `\"data-cy\"` attribute to the element you want to interact to:\n\n<img src={bestPracticesSelectingElementsImg} className=\"image-center\" alt=\"Best Practices selecting elements with Cypress\" />\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>Best Practices Selecting Elements</p>\n\n### Run your test!\n\nOnce you have written your test, it is time to execute it locally:\n\n1. First, you have to run the back-end executing this command at the root project folder:\n\n```bash\n$ make run-local\n```\n\n2.

Meshery is created by the <Link to=\"/community\">Layer5</Link>.\n\nLayer5 is a community-first, service mesh company which has technology <Link to=\"/partners\">partnerships</Link> with various tech giants like Microsoft, HashiCorp, CNCF, RedHat and many more to enlist. The community consists of open source leaders like maintainers of trending open-source projects, Google SoCers, Docker Captains, service mesh maintainers, Cloud Native Ambassadors and many more (<a href=\"http://slack.layer5.io\">join in!</a>).\n\n\n### What is mesheryctl?\n\nMeshery provides you with a clean, robust, streamlined command-line interface to manage and benchmark your service meshes, `mesheryctl`. With `mesheryctl`, not only you can manage your adapters & containers but you can also benchmark your mesh using the command line. `mesheryctl` provides support to a number of platforms so that we never miss out users. `mesheryctl` can be installed with a single bash command by simply executing:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n````\n\nin your terminal. You will see Meshery getting installed & fired up on port: 9081.\nYou will see the output as\n\n\n```\nExtracting mesheryctl-v0.3.14...\nArchive:  /Users/user/meshery.zip\n  inflating: LICENSE\n  inflating: README.md\n  inflating: mesheryctl\n\nInstalling mesheryctl in /usr/local/bin.\nmesheryctl installed.\npermissions moved to user\nRemoving installation files and opening Meshery...Updating Meshery now...\nPulling meshery          ... download complete\nPulling meshery-istio    ... done\nPulling meshery-linkerd  ... done\nPulling meshery-consul   ... done\nPulling meshery-octarine ... done\nPulling meshery-nsm      ... done\nPulling meshery-cpx      ... done\nPulling watchtower       ... done\n```\n\nand you will be able to see the Meshery UI on `https://localhost:9081`.\n\nIf you are wondering if bash is only way to get `mesheryctl`, then here is the list of platforms which you can get `mesheryctl describing all the different ways to get it.\n\n<table className=\"table-1\" align=\"center\">\n<thead>\n    <tr>\n    <th align=\"left\">Platform</th>\n    <th >Supported?</th>\n    </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <td ><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/docker\">Docker</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/docker\">Docker - Docker App</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/kubernetes\">Kubernetes</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/aks\">Kubernetes - AKS</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Kubernetes - Docker Desktop</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/eks\">Kubernetes - EKS</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/gke\">Kubernetes - GKE</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/kubernetes#helm\">Kubernetes - Helm</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/minikube\">Kubernetes - Minikube</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - Kubernetes - OpenShift</td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">In Progress</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Linux</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Mac</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl#homebrew\">Mac - Homebrew</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/windows\">Windows</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl#scoop\">Scoop</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/windows#wsl\">WSL2</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td>Raspberry Pi</td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">In Progress</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<br/>\nWe believe we have not missed any of the popular platforms for what it’s worth, we will be rolling out support for RaspberryPi and OpenShift soon 🎉🎉🎉.\n\nIf you are thinking about the requirements you would have to run `mesheryctl`, so to your surprise, to successfully run `mesheryctl` you will only need :\n\n<table align=\"center\" className=\"table-box\"><tbody><tr><td className=\"text-centre\">a running Docker daemon</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n### Into the MesheryCTL\n\nOnce you have successfully installed, you will be having the power of a new CLI Command MesheryCTL. As you type `mesheryctl` into your terminal, you will be shown with the various sub-commands and flags `mesheryctl` can support.\n\n```\nMeshery is the cloud native management plane, providing lifecycle, performance, and configuration management of service meshes and their workloads.\n\nUsage:\n  mesheryctl [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:\n  help        Help about any command\n  perf        Performance Management\n  system      Meshery Lifecyle Management\n  version     Print mesheryctl version\n\n\nFlags:\n      --config string    config file (default location is: $HOME/.meshery//meshery.yaml)\n  -h, --help            help for mesheryctl\n  -v, --version         Version of mesheryctl\n\nUse \"mesheryctl [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\n```\n\nOnce you do `mesheryctl system start`, Meshery will pull its adapters and latest docker images. Meshery will also detect your Kubernetes configuration and will let you know if Kubernetes is running. Meshery will run it’s web-based user interface on localhost port `9081` and will let you select your choice of <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility#providers\">Provider</a> before you can start managing your service meshes with this powerful utility.\n\n<table align=\"center\" className=\"table-box\"><tbody><tr><td className=\"text-centre\">One of the most interesting sub-commands of <code>mesheryctl</code> is <strong><code>perf</code></strong>.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nThe `perf` subcommand enables you to being managing the performance of your service mesh deployment and your workloads running atop of them. It lets you benchmark your service mesh without using the Meshery UI from the command line interface itself. Once you type `mesheryctl perf`, it will present you with all the powerful flags you can control with CLI, including providing it with a `--file` flag that points to any of a number of performance test profiles that you may have saved.\n\n```\nPerformance Management and Benchmarking using Meshery CLI.\n\nUsage:\n  mesheryctl perf --[flags]\n\nAvailable Flags for Performance Command:\n  name[string]                  (optional) A short descriptor to serve as reference for this test. If not provided, a random name will be generate.\n  url[string]                   (required) URL endpoint to send requests.\n  duration[string]              (required) Length of time to perform test (e.g 30s, 15m, 1hr). See standard notation https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration\n  load-generator[string]        (optional) Name of load generator to be used to perform test (default: \"fortio\")\n  mesh[string]                  (optional) Name of the service mesh to be tested (default: \"None\")\n  provider[string]              (required) Choice of Provider (default: \"Meshery\")\n  concurrent-requests[string]   (optional) Number of parallel requests to be sent (default: \"1\")\n  qps[string]                   (required) Queries per second (default: \"0\")\n  file[string]                  (optional) file containing SMPS-compatible test configuration. See https://github.com/layer5io/service-mesh-performance-specification\n  help                          Help for perf subcommand\n\nurl, duration, concurrent-requests, and qps can be considered optional flags if specified through an SMPS compatible yaml file using --file\n```\n\nAn example usage of `mesheryctl perf --[flags]` can be\n\n```bash\n mesheryctl perf --name \"a quick stress test\" --url http://192.168.1.15/productpage --qps 300 --concurrent-requests 2 --duration 30s --token \"provider=Meshery\"\n```\n\nYou can also provide a SMPS Configuration file with `perf` subcommand, with this file provided you will not have to specify url, duration, concurrent-requests & qps. However, if specified the value provided through file will be over-rided by value through CLI. For more info about file configuration, see [here](https://github.com/service-mesh-performance/service-mesh-performance/blob/master/docs/assets/spec/readme/service%20mesh%20performance%20specification%20result.yaml).\n\n```bash\n mesheryctl perf --name \"a quick stress test\" --file {path}/smps.yaml --token \"provider=Meshery\"\n```\n\n### What's next?\n\nMeshery is an ever-growing community with attracting contributors from across the globe.

Meshery already supports a number of leading mesh providers with adapters for additional meshes on the way. In today’s video, I’ll show how to use Meshery for rolling out and evaluating Linkerd.\n\n Linkerd is a system that comes from the service mesh pioneers - the company called Buoyant. They were the first to realise the need for a distributed network of smart, centrally configured proxies and coin the term “service mesh” back in 2016. Today, we’ll be looking at Linkerd 2.x - the second generation of this now CNCF project.\n</div>\n<div>\n<h5>Meshery Adapters</h5>\n    <table className=\"table-adapters\">\n        <thead className=\"hidden\">\n            <th>Status</th>\n            <th>Adapter</th>\n        </thead>\n        <tbody>\n        <tr>\n            <td rowSpan=\"7\" className=\"stable-adapters\">stable</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-istio\">\n                <img src={istio} alt=\"Istio Service Mesh adapter\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Istio\n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-linkerd\"><img src={linkerd} alt=\"Linkerd\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Linkerd</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-consul\"><img src={consul} alt=\"Consul Connect\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Consul</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-octarine\"><img src={octarine} alt=\"Octarine Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Octarine</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-nsm\"><img src={nsm} alt=\"Network Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Network Service Mesh</a></td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td className=\"stable-adapters\"/></tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td rowSpan=\"2\" className=\"beta-adapters\">beta</td>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-cpx\">\n                <img src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQksHj15DkID308qQw3cmkQrRULPxyzbVquSZVev-9dj1L6sPs-rQ&s\" alt=\"Citrix CPX Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Citrix CPX\n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td className=\"beta-adapters\"/></tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td rowSpan=\"6\" className=\"alpha-adapters\">alpha</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-maesh\">\n                <img src={maesh} alt=\"Maesh Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Maesh\n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-app-mesh\">\n                <img src={awsappmesh} alt=\"AWS App Mesh Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for App Mesh \n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n            <td><a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-kuma\">\n                <img src={kuma} alt=\"Kuma Service Mesh\" className=\"adapter-logo\" />Meshery adapter for Kuma\n                </a>\n            </td>\n        </tr><tr>\n        </tr>\n        <tr><td className=\"alpha-adapters\"/></tr>\n        </tbody>\n    </table>\n</div>\n\nSome things that Linkerd is known for:\n\n<li>Purpose-built for Kubernetes</li>\n<li>Featuring custom-built, highly performant proxies written in Rust</li>\n<li>Zero-config option (works out-of-the-box)</li>\n<li>Network telemetry built-in (includes a pre-configured, optimised Prometheus instance)</li>\n<li>Low-overhead control-plane</li>\n<li>Operational simplicity (when compared to Istio, for example, even though Istio is getting better in this regard)</li>\n\nSo what is covered in the video? More or less the following:\n\n<li>What service mesh tech allows us to do</li>\n<li>What a typical service mesh architecture looks like</li>\n<li>What Layer5 is about (<i>Lookout - it may surprise you!</i> 😯)</li>\n<li>What Meshery is. What Linkerd is.</li>\n<li>How easy it is to install Meshery on your PC (be it Linux, Mac or Windows)</li>\n<ul>\n<li>\nAll it takes is:\n\n```sh\n$ curl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n```\n\n</li></ul>\n<li>How Meshery connects to your Kubernetes cluster (nothing to be done if it’s in your <code>kubectl config current-context</code>)</li>\n<li>How to correctly install and remove Linkerd on your Kubernetes cluster using Meshery</li>\n<li>How to install one of included Linkerd sample applications and verify the installation</li>\n\nThat’s quite a lot of content for a 20 minute clip. In the follow-up videos, we’ll dive deeper into many of these concepts. And also show how to use Meshery with other service mesh providers.\n\nThis video is also the opening shot of Layer5's [Learn to Service Mesh](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3A-A6hPO2IN_HSU0pSfijBboiHggs5mC) playlist, which is specifically dedicated to tutorials and webinars.

[Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery), which is the multi-service mesh management plane.\n2. [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d), which is used to create a dockerized [k3s](https://k3s.io) server.\n\nAnd, what really appealed to me about both of them is that everything from the installation to the usage was just *simple!*\nAnd cream on the top, both softwares are used with or inside containers, making each ideal for a create/try/delete workflow.\n\n<h4>Environment Setup</h4>\n\nBefore we start having *real* fun with Meshery, I will quickly list the different components I used for this blog post and ensure I define what could be optional for your own setup:\n1. [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery)\n2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)\n    - Docker is of course mandatory and as Meshery is based on a Compose file, which means that [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is also mandatory.\n3. [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d)\n    - k3d or any k3s/K8s cluster that you might have already configured.\n4. [WSL2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/)\n    - For the (few) ones who know me, my \"OS base\" is WSL2, which means that without much/any change, it should run fine for any Linux/MacOS setup.\n5. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) *(optional)*\n    - Grafana is not mandatory however is strongly recommend. We will setup a dockerized instance, but feel free to plug Meshery with your existing instance.\n\n<h4> Nothing is taken for granted </h4>\n\nFor the sake of making the blog post around Meshery, I won't explain how to install each component and will focus only on getting k3d and Meshery working.\n\nThat said, I do not take anything for granted and as Scott Hanselman once taught me: there is no \"just have to ...\" or \"by simply doing ...\".\n\nIf you face any issue with your setup (hopefully WSL2), just let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nunixtech) or on the [Layer5 Slack channel](http://slack.layer5.io).\n\n<h4>Meshery Installation</h4>\n\nFor the following steps, I will use the Ubuntu 18.04 WSL2 distro:\n\n- Start docker and confirm it's running:\n\n```bash\nsudo service docker start\ndocker version\n```\n\n- Using Docker, install Meshery on your local machine by running the following:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n```\n<a href={wsldockerstart}>\n    <img src={wsldockerstart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wsl-docker-start\" />\n</a>\n\n- Create a new k3d cluster with the <code> WSL2 IP </code>\n\n```bash\nexport mainIP=`hostname -I | awk '{ print $1 }'`\nk3d list\nk3d create --workers 3 --api-port ${mainIP}:6443\nexport KUBECONFIG=\"$(k3d get-kubeconfig --name='k3s-default')\"\nkubectl cluster-info\n```\n\n<a href={wslk3dstart}>\n    <img src={wslk3dstart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslk3dstart\" />\n</a>\n<br/>\n- Start Meshery on the newly created cluster\n\n```bash\nmesheryctl system start\n```\n\n<a href={wslmesherystart}>\n    <img src={wslmesherystart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslmesherystart\" />\n</a>\n- Once Meshery is fully started, login in your preferred browser using the <code>WSL2 IP</code> instead of <code>localhost</code>\n\n```bash\nexport BROWSER=/mnt/c/Firefox/firefox.exe\n$BROWSER $mainIP:9081 &\n```\n\n<a href={wslmesherylogin}>\n        <img src={wslmesherylogin} alt=\"wslmesherylogin\" />\n</a>\n<a href={wslmesheryloginsuccess}>\n    <img src={wslmesheryloginsuccess} alt=\"wslmesheryloginsuccess\" />\n</a>\n\n\n#### [Optional] More analytics with Grafana\nAs stated above, Meshery can leverage the analytics provided by Grafana. For this blog post, as everything is built from scratch. Here is the setup for a new Grafana dockerized instance.\n\nStart a new Grafana on docker instance\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n-d \\\n-p 3000:3000 \\\n--name=grafana \\\n-e \"GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL=http://$mainIP\" \\\n-e \"GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=MesheryInstance\" \\\ngrafana/grafana\n```\n\n<a href={wslgrafanastart}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanastart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanastart\" />\n</a>\n\n- Access the new instance with the admin password that you set in the docker environment variable\n```bash\n$BROWSER $mainIP:3000 &\n```\n\n<a href={wslgrafanalogin}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanalogin} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanalogin\" />\n</a>\n<br />\n<a href={wslgrafanaloginsuccess}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanaloginsuccess} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanaloginsuccess\" />\n</a>\n\n### An inside look\nWhile everything should run fine, it's always good to have a look at what has been deployed.\n\nIn this case, we are almost exclusively working with Docker and the \"inside look\" should look something like this:\n\n<a href={wslmesherycomplete}>\n    <img src={wslmesherycomplete}className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslmesherycomplete\" />\n</a>\n\n#### Conclusion\nAs [Lee Calcote](https://twitter.com/lcalcote) put it, this is a lot of buzz words: Meshery > k3s (deployed via k3d) > Docker > WSL2 > Windows 10. And he's totally right, still the \"beauty\" here, is that it \"simply works\".\n\nSince the begin of the Docker era, new tooling has appeard for simplifying complex workflows.\nEven Kubernetes (K8s) as a much lighter version with k3s by Rancher.\n\nAnd of course, Meshery which integrates and simplifies the installation and benchmarking of different service meshes. Hope you had fun assembling all these pieces and stay tunned for the \"Bonuses\", more fun to come!\n\n<span> > > > <i>Nunix out</i></span>\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Getting started with Meshery, WSL2 and k3d","subtitle":"","date":"July 9th, 2019","author":"Nuno do Carmo","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrgAAABXRUJQVlA4IKwAAAAwBQCdASoUABQAPtFgqU+oJSOiKAgBABoJagDHMywTmwXkh8XuWw62pPgeLa6iGOkYAAD+9R4SKH1oL6udrBkwr5rrkLRIeudVijKFQQi4NBpAgn1GqiLKGll7/coQQQ8X2m4ARFICZ1eH4EKwlMH79KOgYAEP9qeZU1fXG+Jmj3mSYoA/SF+9X/WI4UZXzEZSPBXefiBldNQhjxeWdjq9FujdEnATM/mAAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp 400w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/cnab-logo.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrgAAABXRUJQVlA4IKwAAAAwBQCdASoUABQAPtFgqU+oJSOiKAgBABoJagDHMywTmwXkh8XuWw62pPgeLa6iGOkYAAD+9R4SKH1oL6udrBkwr5rrkLRIeudVijKFQQi4NBpAgn1GqiLKGll7/coQQQ8X2m4ARFICZ1eH4EKwlMH79KOgYAEP9qeZU1fXG+Jmj3mSYoA/SF+9X/WI4UZXzEZSPBXefiBldNQhjxeWdjq9FujdEnATM/mAAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/d8057/cnab-logo.webp 100w,\n/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/2e34e/cnab-logo.webp 200w,\n/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp 400w","sizes":"(min-width: 400px) 400px, 100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":500,"height":500}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/cnab-logo.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/getting-started-with-meshery-wsl2-and-k3d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"category":"Meshery"}},"staticQueryHashes":["1376321266","1485533831","2848499768","3205812809","4047814605","961506260"],"matchPath":"/blog/category/meshery"}
