This allows you to control and restrict permissions for various resources. In this blog post, we will explore the process of binding a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole. We will also discuss how Meshery, a service mesh management tool, can be utilized to streamline the lifecycle management of Kubernetes clusters using MeshMap visual diagrams.</p>\n\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2> \n\n<p>Before we delve into the details, ensure that you have the following prerequisites in place:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Access to a running Kubernetes cluster.</li> \n  <li><code>kubectl</code>, the Kubernetes command-line tool, installed and configured to communicate with your cluster.</li>\n  <li>Meshery, the cloud native manager, installed and <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">set up</a> on your local machine.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Binding a Kubernetes Service Account with ClusterRole:</h2>\n\n<p>To bind a Service Account with a ClusterRole, follow the steps outlined below:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Create a Service Account</strong></p>\n<p>First, we need to create a Service Account that we will later bind to a ClusterRole. Use the following kubectl command to create a Service Account named <code>my-service-account</code>:</p>\n\n<pre><code>sh kubectl create serviceaccount my-service-account</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Step 2: Create a ClusterRole</strong></p>\n<p>Next, let's create a ClusterRole that defines the desired permissions. You can either create a new ClusterRole or use an existing one. For the purpose of this example, we will create a ClusterRole named <code>my-cluster-role</code> that has read-only access to Pods and Services:</p>\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRole\nmetadata:\n  name: my-cluster-role\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\"]\n  resources: [\"pods\", \"services\"]\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"]\n```\n<br />\n<p>Save the above YAML definition to a file named <code>clusterrole.yaml</code>, and create the ClusterRole using the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bash kubectl apply -f clusterrole.yaml</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p><strong>Step 3: Bind the Service Account with ClusterRole</strong></p>\n<p>Finally, we need to bind the Service Account <code>my-service-account</code> with the ClusterRole <code>my-cluster-role</code>. This can be achieved by creating a ClusterRoleBinding. Execute the following command to create the binding:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bash kubectl create clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding --clusterrole=my-cluster-role --serviceaccount=default:my-service-account</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p>The above command creates a ClusterRoleBinding named <code>my-cluster-role-binding</code> that associates the Service Account <code>my-service-account</code> with the ClusterRole <code>my-cluster-role</code>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Verification:</strong></p>\n<p>To verify the successful binding, you can use the following command to check the ClusterRoleBinding:</p>\n\n<pre><code>bash kubectl describe clusterrolebinding my-cluster-role-binding</code></pre>\n<br />\n<p>You should see the Service Account and ClusterRole information listed under the <code>Subjects</code> and <code>RoleRef</code> sections, respectively.</p>\n\n<h2>Using Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes Cluster Lifecycle Management:</h2>\n<p>Meshery is a powerful service mesh management tool that simplifies the management and operation of service meshes, including <a href=\"https://layer5.io/blog/meshery/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kubernetes clusters</a>. MeshMap, a visual diagram feature of Meshery, provides a graphical representation of the service mesh components and their interactions.</p>\n\n<p>To utilize Meshery and MeshMap for Kubernetes cluster lifecycle management, follow these steps:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 1: Install Meshery</strong></p>\n<p>Refer to the official Meshery <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">documentation</a> to install Meshery on your local machine or within your Kubernetes cluster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Connect to Your Kubernetes Cluster</strong></p>\n<p>Once Meshery is installed, connect it to your Kubernetes cluster by configuring the necessary authentication and connection details.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Access MeshMap</strong></p>\n<p>After successfully connecting Meshery to your Kubernetes cluster, you can access MeshMap from the <a href = \"https://playground.meshery.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meshery</a> user interface. MeshMap visually represents the deployed service mesh, including service endpoints, traffic flows, and workload distribution.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4: Visualize the Kubernetes Cluster with MeshMap</strong></p>\n<p>Once you have accessed Meshery and connected it to your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps to visualize the cluster using MeshMap:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>From the Meshery user interface, navigate to the MeshMap section.</li>\n  <li>Select your connected Kubernetes cluster from the dropdown menu.</li>\n  <li>Click on the \"Generate Map\" button to generate a visual representation of the service mesh components and their interactions within the cluster.</li>\n  <li>Explore the generated MeshMap to gain insights into your Kubernetes cluster's architecture, traffic patterns, and workload distribution.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>In this blog post, we have learned how to bind a Kubernetes Service Account with a ClusterRole to control access and authorization within a cluster. We have also explored how Meshery and its MeshMap feature can be used for visualizing the service mesh components and their interactions within a Kubernetes cluster. By following these steps, you can effectively manage and monitor your Kubernetes cluster's lifecycle using RBAC and visualization tools.</p>\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"How To Bind Kubernetes Service Account with ClusterRole","date":"Jun 30th, 2023","author":"Layer5 Team","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/bb8ee/blog-post.png","srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/0dee1/blog-post.png 750w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/8beaa/blog-post.png 1080w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/bb8ee/blog-post.png 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/a66aa/blog-post.webp 750w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/65dd5/blog-post.webp 1080w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/edb28/blog-post.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}},"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/blog-post.png"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/png;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/bb8ee/blog-post.png","srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/0dee1/blog-post.png 750w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/8beaa/blog-post.png 1080w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/bb8ee/blog-post.png 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/a66aa/blog-post.webp 750w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/65dd5/blog-post.webp 1080w,\n/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/edb28/blog-post.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}},"extension":"png","publicURL":"/static/87c3e5e43ab121617b3f31b331d94df7/blog-post.png"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/how-to-bind-kubernetes-service-account-with-clusterrole"}},{"id":"515bf6db-37bb-5a06-9892-326ee784c2f6","body":"\n\nimport MesheryVersion from \"./meshery-version.png\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<p>\n  Meshery is constantly evolving and improving, with new features and bug fixes being added regularly. To stay up to date with the latest Meshery features and updates, you can switch between different release channels.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Artifacts of the builds for Meshery and its components are published under two different release channels, so that improved controls may be provided to both  Meshery users and Meshery developers. The two release channels are edge and stable release channels. Relative to stable releases, edge releases occur much more frequently. Edge releases are made with each merge to master, unless that merge to master is for a stable release. Stable releases are made with each\n  merge to master when a GitHub release tag is also present in the workflow.\n</p>\n\n<h2> How release channels offer subscription </h2>\n<p>\n  Release Channels offers a subsciption where user can subscribe to a specific  release channel and get notified when a new release is available. This is  useful for users who want to stay up to date with the latest Meshery features, while also also providing flexibility for users who want to stay on a specific version of Meshery.\n  However, this approach can be risky because some updates may introduce bugs or compatibility issues that could break your existing installation. Depending upon your risk aversion and the nature of your deployment environment, having a subscription means that you will automatically receive these updates that you might not be ready incorporate. On the other hand, release channels also offer the ability to pin to a specific release which is a  good thing as it allows users to maintain stability and predictability of their environment by preventing unexpected changes from being introduced into their system. However, doing so cancels out any future subscription-based benefits such as receiving security patches or bug fixes that were added after that version was released.\n\nTherefore, it's important for you to weigh the pros and cons of each option before making decisions on how you want to manage your Meshery deployment. It's recommended you and your organizations have a well-defined upgrade strategy based on testing and validation procedures prior to applying new releases in production environments whether via subscriptions or manual upgrades to ensure that system availability is maintained and risks are minimized.\n\n</p>\n<p>\nTo subscribe to a specific release channel or version using mesheryctl you can use \n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set [stable|stable-version|edge|edge-version] </code></pre>\nThis command will update your local Meshery configuration to use the selected channel for future updates. To set the channel to a specific version, replace Version with the desired version number. Example: <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set stable</code> or <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel set stable-v0.5.56</code>\n</p>\n<h2> Switching between Release Channels</h2>\n<p>There are two ways to switch between Meshery release channels: using mesheryctl or by editing your meshconfig file. In this blog post, we'll cover both methods.</p>\n\n<h3>What is Meshconfig?</h3>\n<p>\n  Meshconfig is a configuration file that is used to configure Meshery. It is typically located in the <code>~/.meshery/config.yaml</code> directory. It contains information about the current release channel, the version of Meshery that is installed, and other configuration options that are specific to your Meshery installation. \n  Meshconfig is automatically generated when you run Meshery for the first time. It is also automatically updated when you update Meshery\n</p>\n\n<ol>\n<h3>Switching between Meshery release channels using meshconfig file.</h3>\n<p>Open your terminal and confirm that you have mesheryctl installed by running  <code>mesheryctl version</code>. If you don't have mesheryctl installed, you can install it by following the instructions in the  <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl\">Meshery documentation</a>.</p>\n<li>\nCreate new Meshery config.yaml file <pre><code className=\"language=bash\">mesheryctl system context create [context-name]</code></pre>\n</li>\nExample: <br/> <code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context create new-context --components meshery-istio meshery-osm meshery-linkerd --platform docker --url http://localhost:9081 --set --yes </code>\n<li> To view the newly created meshery context use <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context view [context-name]</code></pre></li>\n<li>After making these changes, you can switch between different context by using <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context switch</code></pre></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Switching between Meshery release channels using mesheryctl.</h3>\n<p>mesheryctl is a command-line tool for managing Meshery. You can use it to switch between different release channels. Here's how:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Run the following command to see the current configuration for Meshery:</li>\n<pre>\n<code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system context view</code>\n</pre>\n<img src={MesheryVersion} className=\"image-center\"  style={{width: \"50%\"}}></img>\n<p>This will show you the currently channels ,<b>stable</b> or <b>edge</b>, along with the version number and other information.</p>\n<li>Run the following command to switch to a different release channel:</li>\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel switch</code></pre>\nThis command will update your meshconfig file to switch release channel and version of context in focus. To switch the channel to a specific version, replace <b>Version</b> with the desired version number.\n<li> To confirm that the channel has been changed, run the following command again: <pre><code className=\"language-bash\">mesheryctl system channel view</code></pre></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Conclusion </h2>\n\n<p>\n  Switching between Meshery release channels is a simple and straightforward process.

Many people inside and outside of the Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions, but may not know the backstory as to who Yash is and how you arrived at your MeshMate role. Indulge us. How did you discover the Layer5 community? What made you stay?\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Yash:</span>\n  <p>\n    \"Hey Vivek, thanks for having me! One day, I was scrolling through Twitter and saw someone praising the Layer5 community. I was curious, so I checked it out and joined their Slack channel. As a newbie to open-source, I was unsure about many things, but Shivam ( an amazing contributor ), welcomed me and suggested I should attend the Meshery Dev meet to learn more.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    \"I picked up some issues and started working on them but soon hit a wall. Then one day, Lee Calcote messaged me and said he had me on his intern's list, but noticed I wasn't around the community much. So I reached out to Abhishek and Gaurav for help on how to get more involved. They showed me how to contribute and help others, and then I started attending dev calls, helping others, and making new friends.\"\n  </p>\n<p>\n”After a while, I received a message from Lee and Gaurav saying that I would look good in the MeshMate logo I was surprised. It was one of the best things to happen to me, but also came with a responsibility to help others in the community and guide them on their journey.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n  <p>You’re a MeshMate and have been for some long time now.

MeshMates are individuals who are committed to help other members of the community. This includes ensuring that community members have access to resources, are introduced to other members, and understand the vision and goals of the projects.”\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    \"I have always loved learning in a community because with a community, we can grow together. Similarly, MeshMates always make sure that their mentees are successful along with the project. It's a great feeling to be a part of a community where everyone is working towards the same goal and supporting each other along the way.\"\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Vivek:</span>\n  <p>\n    What’s the coolest Meshery demo you have done/seen?\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Yash:</span>\n  <p>\n    \"I remember introducing Meshery and Meshmap in my college event. It was an incredibly successful event, and I take great pride in being a part of a community that supports such innovative projects. The response from the attendees was overwhelming, and I am grateful for the hard work and dedication of all the contributors who played a pivotal role in making this project a resounding success. Their collective efforts truly deserve admiration and appreciation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n  <p>\n    What is your favorite part of the Layer5 Community?

Layer5 offers internships all the time and these internships are offered to those who make impact in community and contribute consistently. After 2 months of making impact and contributing consistently I got mail with offer of internship.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    \"Layer5 is growing everyday and many people started using Meshery, MeshMap and other projects for their businesses with this growth my personal goal is to work start helping projects in field of Devops and backend and also I like learning and sharing in public so I’ll also try to spread word of what we do here to appreciate everyone's effort.\"\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Vivek:</span>\n<p>\nNow, I’ve heard of Community Badges, but what are these?

I would really like to see you getting so many badges Vivek 😉.\"\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    \"Badges are not also easy to take, this requires your efforts and time towards community and its projects.

provides a Service to offer a unified traffic endpoint for the Pods. While it offers a VIP to the clients for access and Kubernetes ensures traffic balancing for the accessing back-end Pods, it has a limitation of routing traffic from outside the cluster. To overcome this issue, a new feature called \"NodePort\" has been introduced. \n\nBy setting up a mapping to a specific port of all nodes in the cluster, a NodePort Service redirects traffic from the outside to the inside of the cluster. When a NodePort Service is created, Kubernetes control plane allocates its corresponding ports in two ways. The first is dynamic, where Kubernetes control plane automatically assigns an unused port at the creation time. The second is static, which assigns a port within the nodeport port range configuration. It is crucial to assign a unique nodePort across the entire cluster while manually assigning nodePort, or it will result in an error if a service of type NodePort already uses that port. \n\nSometimes, there is a need to run a NodePort Service on well-known ports so that other components and users inside or outside the cluster can use them. In such cases, users need to reserve the required ports before using them. Kubernetes 1.27 introduced a new feature gate \"ServiceNodePortStaticSubrange\" that allows users to use a different port allocation strategy for type NodePort Services. Enabling this feature gate will divide the port range for NodePort Services based on a formula that uses nodeport size and determines the size of the static port range.\n\nHere are a few examples of different port ranges and their band offset values:\n<div className=\"table-3\">\n\n| Range properties | Values |\n| --- | --- |\n| service-node-port-range | 30000-32767 |\n| Band Offset | 86 |\n| Static band start | 30000 |\n| Static band end | 30085 |\n| Dynamic band start | 30086 |\n| Dynamic band end | 32767 |\n\n</div>\n<br />\n<div className=\"table-3\">\n\n| Range properties | Values |\n| --- | --- |\n| service-node-port-range | 30000-30015 |\n| Band Offset | 16 |\n| Static band start | 30000 |\n| Static band end | 30015 |\n| Dynamic band start | N/A |\n| Dynamic band end | N/A |\n\n</div>\n\nNodePort Services can be useful in many scenarios. For example, consider a user that needs to expose a Minio object storage service on Kubernetes to clients running outside the Kubernetes cluster. The agreed port is 30009, and the user needs to create a Service as follows:\n\n```\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: minio\nspec:\n  ports:\n  - name: api\n    nodePort: 30009\n    port: 9000\n    protocol: TCP\n    targetPort: 9000\n  selector:\n    app: minio\n  type: NodePort\n```\nIf the port required for the Minio Service is not reserved and another NodePort (or possibly LoadBalancer) Service is created and dynamically allocated before or concurrently with the Minio Service, the TCP port 30009 might be allocated to that other Service. In this case, creation of the Minio Service will fail due to a node port collision. \n\nIn conclusion, using the NodePort Service will help Kubernetes users by allowing traffic to be routed from outside to inside the cluster, providing a unified traffic endpoint for the Pods. By enabling the ServiceNodePortStaticSubrange feature gate, users can adopt a different port allocation strategy, reducing the risk of collisions while using a different range of ports.\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Kubernetes NodePorts - Static and Dynamic Assignments","date":"May 12th, 2023","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRr4AAABXRUJQVlA4ILIAAABQBACdASoUABQAPtFcpU6oJSMiKAqpABoJagCdAA7o/xI+daMhu4ZyKIc8AP5sMkrm/KSMElhNhyFx1gsn7iAKtDbnb2EOpN1Lu4ERxHR8dZzo2nLfaBjTkL7HUoWJ2ZeN3kbroyt5qSiHJrjn1s8R/0YvwxgPzzQOJ6Z6/jny3fK+Q/p/RG8WRYpz7F7kTd49j//OPWbkB/vQwHCyP2a8pf47eyzW5wuh8SG+Fee1AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/c1587/k8s-nodeports.webp","srcSet":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/4f03f/k8s-nodeports.webp 750w,\n/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/c1587/k8s-nodeports.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/k8s-nodeports.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRr4AAABXRUJQVlA4ILIAAABQBACdASoUABQAPtFcpU6oJSMiKAqpABoJagCdAA7o/xI+daMhu4ZyKIc8AP5sMkrm/KSMElhNhyFx1gsn7iAKtDbnb2EOpN1Lu4ERxHR8dZzo2nLfaBjTkL7HUoWJ2ZeN3kbroyt5qSiHJrjn1s8R/0YvwxgPzzQOJ6Z6/jny3fK+Q/p/RG8WRYpz7F7kTd49j//OPWbkB/vQwHCyP2a8pf47eyzW5wuh8SG+Fee1AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/c1587/k8s-nodeports.webp","srcSet":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/4f03f/k8s-nodeports.webp 750w,\n/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/c1587/k8s-nodeports.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/7ff62eaeba27512aa31c04535a060e72/k8s-nodeports.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/kubernetes/kubernetes-nodeports-static-and-dynamic-assignments"}},{"id":"52dd5ac9-24dd-5ebc-803f-b290e574fb6a","body":"\nimport mesheryMostPopular from \"./meshery-most-popular-lfx-internship.webp\";\nimport Playfield from \"./layer5-community-playfield.webp\";\n\n{/*import powerOfMeshery from \"../../../../assets/images/playground/gitops-explore-design.webp\";\nimport MesheryStats from \"./meshery-contrib-stats.webp\";*/}\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nThe Layer5 open source community has reached a milestone that deserves to be celebrated: we're now 4,000 members and growing.

They allow administrators to enforce certain policies on these requests before they are persisted in the etcd database and acted upon by the Kubernetes control plane.\n\nThere are various types of admission controllers available in Kubernetes, such as:\n\n- **NamespaceLifecycle**: This admission controller enforces policies related to namespace creation and deletion.\n- **LimitRanger**: This admission controller enforces resource limits on pods, such as CPU and memory limits.\n- **PodSecurityPolicy**: This admission controller enforces security policies on pods, such as privileged mode, host networking, and volumes.\n\n## Validating Admission Policies\n\nValidating admission policies allow administrators to define custom validation rules for resources being created in the cluster. These rules can be defined using a custom resource definition (CRD) called \"ValidatingWebhookConfiguration\" and are enforced by the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook admission controller.\n\nFor example, an administrator may want to enforce a policy that requires all pods in the cluster to have a specific label. They can define this rule using a ValidatingWebhookConfiguration CRD and configure the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook admission controller to enforce it. Any request to create a pod that does not have the required label will be rejected by the admission controller.\n\nValidating admission policies also allow administrators to use external webhooks to perform the validation. This can be useful when the validation logic is complex or requires access to external resources.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nValidating admission policies is a new feature in Kubernetes that allows administrators to define custom validation rules for resources being created in the cluster. These rules can be enforced using the ValidatingAdmissionWebhook admission controller, and external webhooks can also be used for complex validation logic. This feature can be useful for enforcing policies and ensuring compliance in a Kubernetes cluster.\n\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"What are Kubernetes Validating Admission Controllers?","date":"Feb 3rd, 2023","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpwAAABXRUJQVlA4IJAAAABQBACdASoUABQAPtFgqE+oJSOiKAgBABoJbADBzYrIcLaTwo9+PMnGQagAAP72Av+XnXpDovXZeeq4tTUzLytHh8EOuq1sofHN2IthfXcoC9jFvtZhVo+tDrkfaFYPTkFWBWNyondfXcOX/mOVgrxqRCV7kvjREw4wZJCrfL9qeXzh9e/A/AD1++Ek5WwAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0cda4651daf491c6b40dd404799ca32c/3987a/kubernetes-new.webp","srcSet":"/static/0cda4651daf491c6b40dd404799ca32c/4f03f/kubernetes-new.webp 750w,\n/static/0cda4651daf491c6b40dd404799ca32c/3987a/kubernetes-new.webp 900w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/0cda4651daf491c6b40dd404799ca32c/kubernetes-new.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,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"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4fe429ff2237fa91df4168525bb25419/3987a/kubernetes-new-dark.webp","srcSet":"/static/4fe429ff2237fa91df4168525bb25419/4f03f/kubernetes-new-dark.webp 750w,\n/static/4fe429ff2237fa91df4168525bb25419/3987a/kubernetes-new-dark.webp 900w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4fe429ff2237fa91df4168525bb25419/kubernetes-new-dark.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/kubernetes/what-are-kubernetes-validating-admission-controllers"}},{"id":"6a0f849a-8fcf-586a-9cf3-0beaac085455","body":"\n\n\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n<p>\nAs the final Kubernetes release of 2022, Kubernetes 1.26 is an exciting new release of the popular container orchestration platform. It offers a number of new features and improvements that will help platform engineers and DevOps engineers manage their Kubernetes clusters more effectively. Here are some of the highlights of this release. \n</p>\n<div className=\"intro\">\n  <p>\n    As a longstanding CNCF member, Layer5 has donated two of its open source projects to the CNCF: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> and <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">Service Mesh Performance</Link>. As an end-to-end, open-source, multi-cluster Kuberentes management platform, Meshery makes Day 2 Kubernetes cluster management a breeze. Run Meshery to explore the behavorial changes of this Kubernetes release and what they really mean to you. \n  </p>\n</div>\n\nWhile there are a number of enhancments tracked in this release (38), you need to be aware that there are also a number of features being deprecated (10) in 1.26. In this article, we will focus on some highlighted enhancements, important deprecations, and removals so that you can be confident before upgrading your clusters. \n\nWe'll breakdown new K8s features by category, starting with networking.\n\n## Networking in Kubernetes 1.26\n\n### [Service Internal Traffic Policy](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2086) [Stable]\n\nWhen requests are made to a Kubernetes service, they are randomly distributed to all available endpoints. The new enhancement enriches the API of a service to use node-local and topology-aware routing for internal traffic. The new internalTrafficPolicy field has two options: Cluster (default) and Local. The Cluster option works like before and tries distributing requests to all available endpoints. On the other hand, the Local option only sends requests to node-local endpoints and drops the request if there is no available instance on the same node. The Local option is useful for sending metrics or logs to an agent running as a DaemonSet. \n\n### [Reserve Service IP Ranges for Dynamic and Static IP Allocation](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3070) [Stable]\n\nKubernetes services are assigned a virtual ClusterIP to be reachable inside the cluster. The ClusterIP is either assigned dynamically from a configured Service IP range, or statically set while creating the service resource. There was no possibility of knowing whether another service in the cluster had already used the static ClusterIP before this new stable enhancement. With this change, the IP range is divided into two; this prevents conflicts between services implementing dynamic IP allocation and static IP assignment. The flag --service-cluster-ip-range, with CIDR notation, is part of the Kubernetes API server configuration and is ready to use with the 1.26 release. \n\n### [Support of Mixed Protocols in Services with Type LoadBalancer](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1435) [Stable]\n\nKubernetes Services that use the LoadBalancer type have only supported a single Layer 4 protocol until now. With this enhancement going from graduating to stable in v1.26, it is possible to define a mix of protocols in the same service definition. In other words, this enhancement allows a LoadBalancer Service to serve different protocols (e.g. UDP, TCP) under the same port (e.g. 443). For example, serving both UDP and TCP requests for a DNS or SIP server on the same port. For instance, you can expose a DNS server with a single load balancer IP for both TCP and UDP requests, such as the following:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: multi-protocol-dns-server\nspec:\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  ports:\n    - name: dns-udp\n      port: 53\n      protocol: UDP\n    - name: dns-tcp\n      port: 53\n      protocol: TCP\n  selector:\n    app: dns-server\n```\n\n## Security in Kubernetes 1.26\n\n### [kubelet Credential Provider](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2133) [Stable]\n\nThe kubelet agent has a built-in credential provider mechanism to retrieve credentials for container image registries. It natively supports Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS container image registries for dynamically retrieving their credentials. The new stable enhancement in v1.26 offers a replacement for the in-tree implementations, and creates an API for extensible plugins in the future. \n\n### [SignedSigning Release Artifacts](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3031) [Beta]\n\nEvery Kubernetes release produces a set of artifacts such as binaries, container images, documentation, and metadata. Since the 1.24 release, the artifacts have been signed as an alpha feature. In the 1.26 release, artifact signing graduates to beta to increase software supply chain security for the Kubernetes release process and mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n### [Reduction of Secret-Based Service Account Tokens](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2799) [Beta]\n\n`BoundServiceAccountTokenVolume` has been GA since version 1.22: Service account tokens for pods are obtained via the TokenRequest API and stored as a projected volume. The new enhancement, in beta, eliminates the need to auto-generate secret-based service account tokens. In addition, Kubernetes will warn about using auto-created secret-based service account tokens, and purge the unused ones.\n\n### [Windows Privileged Containers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/1981) [Stable] and [Host Networking](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3503) [Alpha] \n\nPrivileged containers are the ones that have similar access and capabilities to the host processes running on the servers. In Linux environments, they are used heavily in Kubernetes for storage, networking, and management. In this release, support for privileged containers for the Windows environment graduates to stable. Management of processes is heavily different from the operating system standpoint in Linux and Windows. Therefore, privileged containers will also work differently in two environments, but they will ensure the same level of security and operational experience.\n\nIn addition, there is a new alpha-level enhancement in this release to support host networking for Windows pods. Currently, Windows has all the functionality to make containers use the networking namespace of the nodes. The new alpha enhancement enables this functionality from the Kubernetes side, increasing the parity between Linux and Windows containers.\n\n### [Self-User Attribute and Authentication API](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/33250) [Alpha] \n\nKubernetes has no resources to identify and manage users as part of its API. Instead, it uses authenticators to get user attributes from tokens, certificates, OIDC providers, or webhooks. The new alpha feature adds a new API endpoint to see what attributes the current users have. The new API is under authentication.k8s.io with the name SelfSubjectReview, and there is a new corresponding command as well: kubectl auth who-am-i. The new feature will reduce the obscurity of complex authentication and help users debug the authentication stack. \n\n## Scheduling in Kubernetes 1.26\n\n### [Non-Graceful Node Shutdown for StatefulSet Pods](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/2268) [Beta]\n\nAs a platform Kubernetes is hardened and has been deploy by thousands and thousands of users. Hardening of Kubernetes makes itself resistant to disasters. The kubelet agent that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster already uses graceful node shutdown to detect and offboard workloads to other nodes. However, when the shutdown is not detected by the kubelet, the pods of a `StatefulSet` are stuck as `Terminating` and not transferred to a healthy node. The kubelet on the downed node will not delete its pods from Kubernetes API, and the StatefulSet controller will not create new pods with the same name. This happens due to a conflict in the Kubernetes machinery. With this enhancement moving into beta, though, pods will be forcefully deleted along with their volume attachments and new pods will be migrated (created) on healthy nodes.\n\n### [Pod Scheduling Readiness](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3521) [Alpha]\n\nCurrently, pods are considered ready for scheduling as soon as they are created. However, not every pod requires a node, resource allocation, and the start of all its containers immediately after its creation. The new alpha enhancement adds an API to mark pods with their scheduling status: paused and ready. Pods with the .spec.schedulingGates field will be parked in the scheduler and only be assigned to nodes when they are ready to be scheduled.\n\n### [kubectl explain to use OpenAPI v3 for ](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/issues/3515) [Alpha]\n\nUse of OpenAPI v3 means supporting rich type information in `kubectl explan`. Kubernetes has supported OpenAPI v3 as a beta since version 1.24. This richer representation of the fields in the Kubernetes API, means that users can use the `kubectl explain` command to get information that is only detailed in  OpenAPI v3, and not the subset defined OpenAPI v2.\n\n## Deprecations and Removals\n\nConsistent to the Kubernetes API lifecycle is deprecations and removals of APIs in each release. It is strongly suggested to check whether you are using the following APIs and flags before there are breaking changes.\n\n<ul>\n<li>\n  Removal of the `flowcontrol.apiserver.k8s.io/v1beta1` API group for `FlowSchema` and `PriorityLevelConfiguration` requires a migration to the v1beta2 API version.\n</li>\n<li>\n  Removal of the `autoscaling/v2beta2` API version for HorizontalPodAutoscaler requires a migration to the autoscaling/v2 API version. \n</li>\n<li>\n  Removal of legacy and vendor-specific authentication client-go and kubectl for Azure and Google Cloud requires migration to vendor-neutral authentication plugin mechanisms.\n</li>\n<li>\n  Removal of in-tree CSI integration for OpenStack—namely, the `cinder` volume type—requires a migration to use the CSI driver for OpenStack. \n</li>\n<li>\n  Some unused options and flags for the kubectl run command are marked as deprecated in the 1.26 release, such as `--grace-period`, `--timeout`, and `--wait`.\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n## Last Kubernetes release of 2022\n\nKubernetes is an ever-evolving platform. For those of you running workloads on Kubernetes taking detailed note of API changes and enhancements is an important activity as you endevour to keep your clusters upgraded with release releases. A more secure, scalable, and flexible Kubernetes is our collective goal.

One of the key components of Kubernetes is its logging and instrumentation capabilities. The upcoming Kubernetes 1.26 release has a handful of noteworthy changes to its system component logger, <code>klog</code>.</p>\n\n## Kubernetes System Log\n\nSystem component logs record events happening in K8s clusters. More than metrics or traces, logs are the telemetric signal often found to be most useful for debugging. You can configure K8s log verbosity to see more or less detail. Logs can be as coarse-grained as showing errors within a component, or as fine-grained as showing step-by-step traces of events (like HTTP access logs, pod state changes, controller actions, or scheduler decisions).\n\n## Klog\n\n[klog](https://github.com/kubernetes/klog) is a Kubernetes logging library that provides an API for developers and system administrators to instrument their applications for logging and tracing. klog generates log messages for the Kubernetes system components. It provides a comprehensive set of features, including log levels, structured logging and logging context.\n\nKubernetes 1.23 introduced structured logging (in beta) in `klog`. Structured logging is a uniform structure in log messages allowing for programmatic extraction of information. Structured logs can be stored and processed with less effort and cost. The code which generates a log message determines whether it uses the traditional unstructured `klog` output or structured logging.\n\nAs a dependency to structured logging (gated behind `StructuredLogging` feature gate), Kubernetes 1.24 introducted contextual logging (in alpha) in `klog`. Contextual logging builds on top of structured logging. It is primarily about how developers use logging calls: code based on that concept is more flexible and supports additional use cases which will be the topic of a future blog post. \n\n### Klog Deprecations in Kubernetes 1.26\n\nKubernetes has recently announced that it intends to deprecate certain flags related to Klog in its components. This means that Klog-specific flags, such as `--klog-verbosity`, `--klog-vmodule` and `--klog-stderrthreshold` will no longer be supported. This is due to the fact that Klog has been largely superseded by the more comprehensive OpenTelemetry project, which provides a more complete solution for logging and instrumentation.\n\nThe deprecation of Klog-specific flags is a positive step forward for Kubernetes as it moves to OpenTelemetry. This move will ensure that Kubernetes is using the industry-standard logging and instrumentation solution. It will also provide developers and system administrators with a more comprehensive, reliable and consistent experience when instrumenting their applications.\nA goal of this deprecation is one of unblocking development of alternative logging formats. Why does Kubnernetes need another logging format? One reason is performance. Klog performance is much worse than alternatives, for example 7-8x than JSON format:\n\n|logger                 |time [ns/op]|bytes[B/op]|allocations[alloc/op]|\n|-----------------------|------------|-----------|---------------------|\n|Text Infof             |2252        |248        |3                    |\n|Text InfoS             |2455        |280        |3                    |\n|JSON Infof             |1406        |19         |1                    |\n|JSON InfoS             |319         |67         |1                    |\n\nProof of concept implementation of new logging formats were completed to assess the potentional gains of using an alternative format. Results measured on 30s benchmark for passing 2 arguments to format function.\n\n<div className=\"tip\">\n<h3>Tip: Logger Performance Comparison</h3>\n\nInterestingly, Klog isn't the fastest logger in the West, but Uber's open source project [zap ](https://github.com/uber-go/zap) appears to hold that title instead. The following performance test benchmark is an examle of one of a number of scenarios in which loggers can be performance analyzed.\n\n<p>Log a message and 10 fields:</p>\n\n| Package             |    Time     | Time % to zap | Objects Allocated |\n| :------------------ | :---------: | :-----------: | :---------------: |\n| zap                 | 2900 ns/op  |      +0%      |    5 allocs/op    |\n| zap (sugared)       | 3475 ns/op  |     +20%      |   10 allocs/op    |\n| zerolog             | 10639 ns/op |     +267%     |   32 allocs/op    |\n| go-kit              | 14434 ns/op |     +398%     |   59 allocs/op    |\n| logrus              | 17104 ns/op |     +490%     |   81 allocs/op    |\n| apex/log            | 32424 ns/op |    +1018%     |   66 allocs/op    |\n| log15               | 33579 ns/op |    +1058%     |   76 allocs/op    |\n\n</div>\n\nOutput will always be written to stderr, regardless of the output format. Output redirection is expected to be handled by the component which invokes a Kubernetes component. This can be a POSIX shell or a tool like systemd.\n\nThe deprecation of Klog-specific flags is part of a larger effort to transition Kubernetes to a more modern and comprehensive logging and instrumentation solution. This will provide Kubernetes users with a more reliable, secure and consistent experience when instrumenting and monitoring their applications.\n\nKubernetes will continue to provide support for Klog-specific flags for the foreseeable future. However, it is recommended that developers and system administrators begin transitioning their applications to the OpenTelemetry framework. This will ensure that their applications are using the industry-standard solution for logging and instrumentation.\n\nOverall, the deprecation of Klog-specific flags is a positive step forward for Kubernetes. It will ensure that Kubernetes users have access to the most reliable and comprehensive solution for logging and instrumentation.

In this post,\n    we'll take a look behind the scenes at how each component in Meshery's\n    architecture plays a role in the management of many Kubernetes clusters.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n## Philosophy behind Meshery's multi-cluster management approach\n\nWhile designing Meshery for the world of many service meshes, and many Kubernetes clusters, much care has been taken to ensure that Meshery is an <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility\">extensible management platform</a>, ready for handling new types of infrastructure and new use cases rapidly through its plugin model. Under the hood, <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\">Meshery Server</a> acts as a delegator of operations by figuring out which Meshery Adapter registered its capability against the given operation. The operation is then sent to that given component (like one of Meshery’s service mesh adapters,e.g. Istio adapter) via a gRPC call. <img src={CoreArch} alt=\"deploy modal\"  className=\"image-right\" /> When the operation involves a Kubernetes cluster(s), the kubeconfig(s) is sent as a parameter to the RPCs. It is then the job of the handling adapter to respect that and perform the operation across the passed clusters from kubeconfigs as needed. The operations not requiring a kubeconfig are managed through the same RPC, with the only difference being that the handling component would ignore the `kubeconfigs` field altogether making the system work not just for Kubernetes, but for other cloud native use cases. This approach of reusing the same RPC for different types of requests is pretty common and sometimes debatable with the other approach of being strict with the RPCs. This is what makes Meshery completely pluggable and extensible.\n\n## Using multi cluster with Meshery\n\nFrom a client's perspective, there are two uses of the multi context feature in general. While deploying a <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> design or performing any other operation on their cluster(s), selecting any number of Kubernetes contexts will allow them to uniformly and parallely perform the operation across the clusters. And while visualizing the state of their cluster(s), the same context switcher will allow them to filter across the clusters whose view they want to see.\n\nAll cluster specific operations are now applied over a number of clusters uniformly. So if you have 10 clusters to manage and 8 of those start with the exact same set of pods, deployments, service mesh, etc then <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> can help you to apply these operations quickly and easily.\n\nIt is as simple as selecting the specific cluster(s) from the Kubernetes context switcher in the navbar, and then applying whatever operation you wanted to, whether that be deploying a sample app, a service mesh, or a <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> design.\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img src={Switcher} alt=\"context switcher\" className=\"image-center-shadow\" />\n</p>\n\nJust before applying the operation, you will be prompted with a confirmation modal which will provide the information about which cluster(s) that operation will be performed against. As the User interface improves, this same modal will also convey more useful information about the operation they are going to perform.\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img src={Deploy} alt=\"deploy modal\" className=\"image-center-shadow\" />\n</p>\n\n<br />\n\n### Using MeshMap visualizer\n\nYou can switch between views of your cluster in visualizer mode while using <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link>.\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img\n    src={Cluster2}\n    alt=\"visualizer showing data of context1\"\n    className=\"slides-right\"\n  />\n</p>\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n  <img\n    src={Cluster1}\n    alt=\"visualizer showing data of context2\"\n    className=\"slides-left\"\n  />\n</p>\n\n### Managing Meshery on multiple clusters\n\nUsers can perform cluster related operations from the settings page like adding more clusters, removing data from existing clusters and removing existing clusters.\n\n<img src={Settings} alt=\"Settings page\" className=\"slides-right\" />\n\nMeshery also deploys Meshery operator across the cluster it’s about to manage. This operator manages the lifecycle of a Meshery broker and MeshSync. MeshSync pumps the blood into Meshery’s core, in other words, it is responsible for watching all different types of resources by establishing a watch stream over each of them. MeshSync then pumps that data into the NATS server, of which Meshery server itself is a client. From there, Meshery server gets all the relevant data related to activities in the cluster.\n\nBy default, <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> wants to be as much aware about your infrastructure as possible to provide value so it deploys its operator across each detected cluster. But you can fine tune this configuration by going over each one of them from the table as shown.\n\n<img\n  src={Cluster}\n  alt=\"Kubernetes multi-cluster management with Meshery\"\n  className=\"image-center-shadow\"\n/>\n\nIf you disconnect your cluster and do not want to persist the data from that cluster then you can perform a fine-grained deletion by deleting all MeshSync data (which are the Kubernetes objects) for that specific cluster.\n\n<img src={Flush} alt=\"flushing MeshSync data\" className=\"image-center-shadow\" />\n## Future of multi-cluster\n\nMeshery as an extension point to your infrastructure provides out-of-the-box value by adding components which can be Kubernetes specific, service mesh specific or custom components to add new functionality. We can now add multi-cluster specific components to provide more abstraction. This model can be used along with Meshery’s multi-mesh capabilities to give an overall multi-mesh multi-cluster experience to the user. For instance, your Istio service mesh spanning across multiple clusters can be abstracted and managed by Meshery using custom components such as VirtualGateway and VirtualDestinationRules. In this case, Meshery’s Istio adapter will handle the logic of converting a VirtualGateway into gateways across the clusters. This abstraction provides high value by powering the service mesh to span across the clusters while the Ops team can configure the mesh with minimal effort.\n\nJust like the example above, many such Meshery extension points are in Meshery to add logic into and add useful functionality. And as more of such extension points are added, Meshery will continue to give more and more power to your cloud native infrastructure.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Management with Meshery","date":"Jul 28th, 2022","author":"Ashish Tiwari","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoAAAABXRUJQVlA4IHQAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwDE2CF54D5t+bwgAP68SM3n4NvbowqxZAxrpC/QYjXpmca9fnDRt2vaA4crmoLs6No+L37Zc43rqKBUXdMCecvSw2drXRb5/RfsD7tY1aZ37HN/ekX7tRAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/c512e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp","srcSet":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/a66aa/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 750w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/65dd5/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1080w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/4fad6/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1366w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/c512e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoAAAABXRUJQVlA4IHQAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwDE2CF54D5t+bwgAP68SM3n4NvbowqxZAxrpC/QYjXpmca9fnDRt2vaA4crmoLs6No+L37Zc43rqKBUXdMCecvSw2drXRb5/RfsD7tY1aZ37HN/ekX7tRAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/c512e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp","srcSet":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/a66aa/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 750w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/65dd5/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1080w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/4fad6/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1366w,\n/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/c512e/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/93e4b9e86c2d9eabe418ca1f023b3e26/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/multi-cluster-kubernetes-management-with-meshery"}},{"id":"0bf099ea-9608-5c18-9882-81c42e07ea75","body":"\n\nimport mesheryui from \"./mesheryui.webp\"; \n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n<p><a href=\"https://meshery.io/\">Meshery</a>'s goal is to make the operation of cloud native infrastructure and the service mesh layer of cloud simplified.

I used to find it fascinating how computer programs operate because they have such a tremendous impact on their users. This has always motivated me to work in the field of computers.\n\nAs I grew up, I was introduced to a broad spectrum of coding languages that enabled us to make the software that we used on the computer. These languages piqued my interest even more. I started exploring and made projects. The more I understood them, the more interesting they got. Slowly I realized that I don’t want to make projects that satisfy just my needs. I want to build something that will be on the internet and will be used by people around the world. With this goal in my mind, I started exploring and hit a gemstone that is open source. I would be working on real-world programming solutions that will be used by people all around the world. This helped me to get started and got me excited about contributing to open source projects. \n\n### First PR at Layer5 \nI still remember the first issue I worked on for Layer5 was the auto labeler on a pull request. I spotted a <code>[good first issue](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+archived%3Afalse+org%3Alayer5io+org%3Ameshery+org%3Aservice-mesh-performance+org%3Aservice-mesh-patterns+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+)</code> tag and expressed interest in working on it despite not knowing what the task was. The issue required knowledge of GitHub Actions, something I was unaware of at the time. After getting the issue assigned, I started researching what GitHub Actions were. I found out that these actions helped automate workflows to build, test, and deploy software. After getting the basics down, I checked if there were any existing GitHub Actions for the auto labeling of the PR. To my surprise, there were a couple of them. \n\nSo before actually making a PR, I experimented with the actions extensively in my private repo. I remember making about 20-25 PR in my private repo to get the auto labeler working fine. After verifying that I got the desired results, I made a PR. I also got to discuss my approach in the [Meshery Development Call](https://layer5.io/community/calendar). I was so nervous at that time since that was the first meeting I attended where I had to make people understand what I did and the strategies I used. I was quite thrilled when my code got merged. I was enthralled to see that my code was working and being useful to the community. This motivated me to make more and more contributions. \n\n<img src={aadityaFirstPr} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Aaditya's first PR merged\" />\n\n### A Journey Never to forget \n\nMy Layer5 journey began with this small issue. I gradually started learning more about the projects and made some impactful contributions. I started to engage in the community more prominently. With the help of these contributions, I learned new technologies and techniques. Contributing to the codebase gave me so much exposure to React.js, which would not have been possible if I had done it on my own. I took up issues that used React.js and started solving them, and in no time, I was comfortable with it. I am thankful that I didn’t wait for me to learn more about react and then start contributing. I have always applied this principle, learning more by doing actual stuff rather than sitting there and getting stuck in the tutorial loop. \n\nAnother new technology I discovered was Jekyll, a static site generator. I was unfamiliar with this technology as well. I started contributing to issues involving Jekyll and slowly understood the basics and how the language works. I was very happy that I was able to make the [compatibility matrix](https://docs.meshery.io/project/compatibility-matrix), using Jekyll. Even my project for <Link to=\"/programs/gsoc\">GSoC</Link> is written in Jekyll. So, going from not knowing what Jekyll is, to making some big changes, did make me happy.  \n\nThe community also helped me boost my confidence. The weekly meetings are responsible for this. The way the meetings required me to explain my fixes and give updates regarding the issues I was working on, helped me get vocal and comfortable with talking to various people. \n\n<img src={aadityaPresenting} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Aaditya Presenting\" /> \n\nI am excited to be accepted as a <Link to=\"/programs/gsoc\">Google Summer of Code</Link> Intern for this Summer of 2022. I am looking forward to contributing more and making an impact here. The project assigned to me is to create a dashboard on <a href=\"https://smp-spec.io/dashboard\">SMP Website</a>. Results from the [CNCF Cluster labs](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action/actions) will be displayed here graphically.  I wish to learn more about cloud native technologies and make contributions on the backend too. I also want to state that this will not be the end. I will be engaged with this community as long as I can and will try to give back as much as I can. \n\n### Appreciation for the Community \n\nFinally, I would like to thank the Layer5 Community for always being so supportive whenever I needed it. I took away a very significant lesson from this experience, there is always something to learn, and there is no harm in asking questions if you don't know the answer. It’s kinda hard to find such a welcoming community. There was not a day that I felt completely lost here, and that is what I adore about this community.\n\nKeep Meshing. Thank you.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My Journey as a Contributor to GSoC Intern at Layer5","date":"Jul 6th, 2022","author":"Aaditya Narayan Subedy","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnoAAABXRUJQVlA4IG4AAAAQBACdASoUAAkAPtFWpUwoJKOiMAgBABoJaAC7ACPyR1T/wCrwBh0AAADieh27WAyux9DtURSUFpmQdMO1pe//vlTfTku3IEaYnRD3EMn9HESus+wI8Qk0fzA1B+joH6o+Ef/jFPEen2l/gsAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/7a906/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 750w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.45185185185185184}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnoAAABXRUJQVlA4IG4AAAAQBACdASoUAAkAPtFWpUwoJKOiMAgBABoJaAC7ACPyR1T/wCrwBh0AAADieh27WAyux9DtURSUFpmQdMO1pe//vlTfTku3IEaYnRD3EMn9HESus+wI8Qk0fzA1B+joH6o+Ef/jFPEen2l/gsAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp","srcSet":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/7a906/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 750w,\n/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/0a6dd/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.45185185185185184}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a63d054dc9395fb406907fbffeeb135f/aaditya-subedy-layer5-intern.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/my-journey-as-a-contributor-to-gsoc-intern-at-layer5"}},{"id":"de0c7552-7a04-5f35-8a06-4b6842d35504","body":"\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<p>Hola folks, </p>\n<p>As a contributor, each of us is always striving hard in the ocean to open more and more pull-requests, but being a contributor just doesn&#39;t mean only raising PRs, it also means reviewing other PRs, pointing out mistakes, helping others in improving the code-quality/code-reusability/code-readability, helping in finding missing edge-cases that haven&#39;t been tackled yet, giving your opinions, writing LGTM, CITY helps nothing but just improving the confidence and engagement of the PR author.</p>\n<p>So put on your <strong>Quality Tester</strong> hats because here I&#39;ll talk about how to test the PRs with the label <code>component/mesheryctl</code> i.e. pull-requests related to <code>mesheryctl</code></p>\n<p>Okay before we start, I&#39;ll like to tell you about <a href=\"https://github.com/cli/cli\">GitHub CLI</a>, it helps you checkout PRs very easily in your local system.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The very first step is to review the PR, suggest changes if you think of any, ask queries, help the author to improve the code quality/readability/reusability, ask questions because asking helps you learn asking more better questions next time.</p></li>\n<li><p>PR authors either attach a video showcasing expected behavior or add written instructions about their fix under <strong>User Acceptance Behavior</strong></p></li>\n<li>\n<p>Now it&#39;s the time to checkout PR in your local system, we can check out any PR like this</p>\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">gh pr checkout https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/4823</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can check if you&#39;re into the same branch as the PR author with </p>\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">git branch</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Well, if we&#39;re testing a PR related to mesheryctl, we need to build the binary from the same branch. change your directory to <code>mesheryctl</code> folder and run</p>\n<pre><code className=\"language-bash\">make</code></pre>\n<p>This will create a mesheryctl binary according to your OS in the same directory</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Now it&#39;s time to test out this newly built binary according to what&#39;s been tackled in the PR and related issues.

Even if the project is small or too big, the creator or the team behind the project needs to curate the documentation very well such that it'll be useful for new end users to refer and learn to use the project, troubleshoot the problems occurred and lot more. Thus, we, Layer5 have curated the documentation for Meshery to meet such purposes. Not to mention, <code>mesheryctl</code>, the CLI client of Meshery needs a curated documentation as well. This blog describes about the evolution of <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page. </p>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Initial Command Reference Design</h3>\n<p>\nThe initial design of <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page is all made using pure markdown and the functionality is handled using Jekyll, the main framework used for Meshery Docs. This handled great at initial stage but had many limitations, such as:\n    <ul>\n        <li>Updation of YAML for data is often required</li>\n        <li>Design was obselete at initial stage</li>\n        <li>No separate pages for each command and subcommand</li>\n    </ul>\n    Thus, the idea for redesigning the <code>mesheryctl</code> reference page was desperately needed.\n    </p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\" alt=\"Meshery Documentation\" target=\"_parent\">\n    <img src = {oldDesign} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Initial design of mesheryctl command reference\" /></a></p>\n\n<h3>Updated Command Reference Design</h3>\n<p>To tackle the shortcomings of the previous design, I was tasked to redesign the <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference page entirely. This was a big task at first glance to me, as I was a new contributor back then. Eventually after manipulating the reference section with help of great folks, I was able to pull off the task and the design was updated. </p> \n<p>\n    <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io\" alt=\"Meshery Documentation\">\n<img src={newDesign} className=\"image-center-shadow\" alt=\"Meshery CLI command reference\" /></a>\n</p>\n<p>The redesign work was done with help of HTML in markdown and with optimization in YAML code. A sample is given below.</p>\n\n```\n    <!-- Copy this template to create individual doc pages for each mesheryctl commands -->\n\n    <!-- Name of the command -->\n    # mesheryctl mesh\n\n    <!-- Description of the command. Preferably a paragraph -->\n    ## Description\n\n    {% assign name = site.data.mesheryctlcommands.cmds[page.command] %}\n    {{ name.description }}\n\n    <!-- Basic usage of the command -->\n    <pre className=\"codeblock-pre\">\n    <div className=\"codeblock\">\n    mesheryctl mesh [flags] \n    </div>\n    </pre>\n    ...........\n```\n\n<h3>Adding auto generation feature in reference</h3>\n<p>As time passed, we realized that the command reference missed something for a while, though the design has been changed. Then, we thought the idea of automating the generation of docs such that developers don't need to change the code in docs section while working towards <code>mesheryctl</code>. That's where we got to know that Cobra library (the library for CLI apps made using golang) has a feature to make doc pages automatically. So we decided to incorporate that feature into <code>mesheryctl</code> docs page as well! After making several changes and a PR, I was finally able to introduce the feature in the docs site!</p>\n\n```\nvar startCmd = &cobra.Command {\n\tUse:   \"start\",\n\tShort: \"Start Meshery\",\n\tLong:  `Start Meshery and each of its service mesh components.`,\n\tArgs:  cobra.NoArgs,\n\tExample: `\n// Start meshery\nmesheryctl system start\n// To create a new context for in-cluster Kubernetes deployments and set the new context as your current-context\nmesheryctl system context create k8s -p kubernetes -s\n// (optional) skip checking for new updates available in Meshery.\nmesheryctl system start --skip-update\n// Reset Meshery's configuration file to default settings.\nmesheryctl system start --reset\n// Silently create Meshery's configuration file with default settings\nmesheryctl system start --yes\n.....\n}\n\t`,\n```\n\n<p>Using this information provided above in each golang file, the markdown page is generated using Cobra CLI library and thus reducing the workload on the developer by automating via <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/blob/master/.github/workflows/mesheryctl-ci.yml#L73\">GitHub Actions</a>.</p>\n<br />\n<p>This is so far on how the <code>mesheryctl</code> command reference is evolved for now. And I hope that it'll continue to evolve in the field of documentation to serve the users to use Meshery in best way possible.</p>\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Evolution of the Meshery CLI Command Reference","date":"Jun 9th, 2022","author":"Aadhitya Amarendiran","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABwBACdASoUAA0APtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJbACdMoGvtgJwx880HleA8ofTgAD+2VgctvGN2cFdfAJj4YJ0Ha8AiiMSiWh82G/yk9ZshKIR54QST0HBPk98AjqzxGHfuVZiMjvT9XDm39S3tEJ+oAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/f06bf/mesheryctl.webp 750w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/8c7d4/mesheryctl.webp 1080w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6316666666666667}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/mesheryctl.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABwBACdASoUAA0APtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJbACdMoGvtgJwx880HleA8ofTgAD+2VgctvGN2cFdfAJj4YJ0Ha8AiiMSiWh82G/yk9ZshKIR54QST0HBPk98AjqzxGHfuVZiMjvT9XDm39S3tEJ+oAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/f06bf/mesheryctl.webp 750w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/8c7d4/mesheryctl.webp 1080w,\n/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/1c0a1/mesheryctl.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6316666666666667}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8b8429808b6e7381fa812bf1f5d29572/mesheryctl.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/evolution-of-the-meshery-cli-command-reference"}},{"id":"6f2b2a4d-337b-556e-9b63-7f45ddf1d976","body":"\n\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nIt all started with my curiosity to find an open-source project with open issues with DevOps and CI/CD labels on them. \nWhile I was searching that on GitHub, I found <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>, one of the projects at Layer5.

Few on the top of the list are as follows, expanding \n[Meshery extension points](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility), exposing node details of the K8s clusters on which Meshery runs <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">performance tests</Link>, \nsupporting [Cilium service mesh adapter](https://github.com/meshery/meshery-cilium) with Meshery, persisting <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link> user preferences with \nMeshery Cloud, migrating Meshery Cloud UI to NextJS, support for user profile on Meshery Cloud and exposing performance profiles \n(generated from Meshery performance tests that run on CNCF hosted runners through [meshery-smp-action](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-smp-action)) \nthrough a public facing API.\n\nIn terms of the learning curve, I learned so much that the knowledge I gained in the past three months overpowers the education I received in the last two years of college, \nif we put in context the applicability of each of the learnings in the software industry. \nI learned and applied the tech stack from Golang, GraphQL, and NextJS to Postgres, SQL, and GoBuffalo to GitHub actions. I got introduced to the topics like \nperformance engineering, service meshes, networking, and several cloud-native tool. While at the same time, I met several experienced developers who are very involved in \nthe communities which revolve around these realms.\n\nOne of the major realizations I got through this internship was that it is okay to make mistakes. There were a few instances where I made mistakes. \nFor instance, once I forgot to add pagination in an SQL query which depressed the whole production instance of Meshery Cloud, which means no one would be able \nto log into Meshery until that gets fixed. Or once I unknowingly used an incorrect default SSH port in a workflow that failed a GitHub action responsible for \npushing the latest Meshery Cloud image to Docker Hub and then updating the deployment in AWS VM. But that was okay, and no one got mad at me, but rather I have \nalways received constructive feedback. I did learn from each mistake and made sure that I dont repeat it because that is all that matters.\n\nI had a great time as an intern @ Layer5. Each day brought new challenges and a desire to raise PRs with great features. I not only learned how to fix bugs but also \nlearned how to avoid them in the first place. I not only learned hard skills but also learned soft skills. I not only learned the meaning of self-reliance but also learned \nthe true meaning of team spirit. All in all, that was one of the most exquisite experiences I have ever had and ofcourse, the best internship experience \n(considering it was my first internship ever!). \n\nI will be engaged in this community and will keep contributing to Layer5 projects as much as possible.\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"LFX Experience at Layer5 - Pranav Singh","date":"Jun 8th, 2022","author":"Pranav Singh","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqIAAABXRUJQVlA4IJYAAACQBACdASoUABMAPtFcqE4oJSQiKAqpABoJYwAD5AjYMLV0rWndMa436sJRUEAA+djEu3IudfT7alQ2p1FNLw5yRf0MGfFZ9VoV/PxezqLUTaMQbqA/0AnQSTsU2j2QxZ8p/gcT0SQ1C+lcW81EyDaiAhX5zsCOXrKtwYDqyDSCgmcETkVeqBYWeNVZ9MpBLceccAWk6AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp","srcSet":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/fa57f/lfx-pranav.webp 750w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.96875}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/lfx-pranav.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqIAAABXRUJQVlA4IJYAAACQBACdASoUABMAPtFcqE4oJSQiKAqpABoJYwAD5AjYMLV0rWndMa436sJRUEAA+djEu3IudfT7alQ2p1FNLw5yRf0MGfFZ9VoV/PxezqLUTaMQbqA/0AnQSTsU2j2QxZ8p/gcT0SQ1C+lcW81EyDaiAhX5zsCOXrKtwYDqyDSCgmcETkVeqBYWeNVZ9MpBLceccAWk6AA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp","srcSet":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/fa57f/lfx-pranav.webp 750w,\n/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/22f4e/lfx-pranav.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.96875}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3126e1a4bf54437aa52f555b13bf2551/lfx-pranav.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/lfx-experience-at-layer5-pranav-singh"}},{"id":"e53b3eb0-0923-51eb-837a-f8d12f5a7fe8","body":"\r\n\r\n\r\nimport mentees from \"./mentees.webp\"\r\nimport meshmate from \"../../../../assets/images/meshmate/meshmate-icon.svg\"\r\n\r\n<BlogWrapper>\r\n\r\n<div className=\"intro\">\r\n<p>\r\nTo newbies, open source contributions may seem daunting. In much the same way that non-techies develop a reverence for programmers courtesy of the film industry’s portrayal of them as wizards whose brains magically sprout up elaborate mathematical models and whose mouths eloquently spew technological jargon, so do newbies perceive contributors: a bunch of techies who debug in seconds, recite programming language documentation by heart and, well, create pull requests in their sleep (this is a bit exaggerated, but you get the point). \r\n</p>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n  <p>\r\n  This perception diminished any notion of our Stack Overflow and W3Schools-dependent selves ever having a shot at open source contribution. It often felt as if we haven’t attained the required caliber of ‘techie-ness’ requisite to join the erudite army of programming soldiers; that our match and stomps wouldn’t match the rhythm of these valiant sergeants. \r\n  </p>\r\n  \r\n  <img src={mentees} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"layer5 mentees\" />\r\n  <p>\r\n  However, <a href=\"https://shecodeafrica.org/programs/contributhon-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">She Code Africa’s Contributhon</a> program deconstructs this perception, moreso for women, by partnering with open source organizations like Layer5 and offering women the opportunity to receive mentorship that eases them into being ardent contributors.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  After a rigorous selection process, we:\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oyindawodu\">Oyindamola Dawodu</a>, Frontend Developer\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edmucious\">Ednah Akoth</a>, Frontend Developer \r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  gained entry into SCA’s second contributhon program and would like to immerse you in the voyage that the contributhon program was through this article.\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <h3>The Leaderboard Project</h3>\r\n  <p>\r\n  For 8 weeks, we have had the chance to immerse ourselves into Layer5’s open source contribution community by curating a leaderboard for <a href=\"https://discuss.layer5.io\">Layer5’s discussion forum</a> to show the most active participants based on various metrics such as likes received and posts created.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  We built this leaderboard to encourage more intentional communication and exert positive peer pressure on community members, thereby subconsciously incentivising them to give more solutions to problems discussed on the forum, and actively engage with content posted by other members\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  The project has presented an immersive learning experience for us, right from learning how to navigate using the ubuntu terminal, learning how to set up a local discourse development environment and render web pages,  examining the discuss API documentation and understanding the API endpoints needed to fetch the required data and designing the UI (User Interface) of the leaderboard. \r\n  </p>\r\n  \r\n  <h3>Challenges We Faced</h3>\r\n  <p>\r\n  Getting acclimated to the intricacies of the discourse development environment has been no easy feat. There were moments where we stared at code on discourse in utter oblivion on its purpose or functionality, or faced version issues that impeded our discourse instance’s ability to run. It sometimes got even more frustrating when something as simple as a fetch instruction that you have been writing for almost the entirety of your programming life fails to work and none of the Stack Overflow fixes work. \r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  This question kept us going; How would we become the ardent <em>while in their sleep bug fixers</em> and prolific contributors if we don’t build the fortitude to weather such disheartening moments?\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n   During moments like these, the Layer5 community, particularly <Link to=\"/community/meshmates\">MeshMates</Link> and our mentors often saved the day, sharing resources or offering explanations on what ought to be done to salvage the situations.\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <h3>Lessons We Learned Along the Way</h3>\r\n  <p>\r\n  Overall, the journey has exercised and built upon our skills repertoire in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Version Control, and induced us into the contribution workflow, right from finding an open issue to work on, setting up the required environment to developing the solution. \r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  Furthermore, receiving feedback from both our mentors and members of the Layer5 community with regards to matters like the scalability of our data fetch methods, potential misuse of the leaderboard metrics to gain advantage, the converse outcome that our leaderboard could have (dishearten new members form contributing due to the seemingly low chance of their input reflecting on the board), more responsive UI fixes among others, helped us to become even more cognizant of the idea that we are developing not just for ourselves and our portfolios, but for a wider and greater audience.\r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  We became more abreast with the idea of developing for a community or for a greater purpose and the imperative role of feedback in that development process. We became more comfortable with the idea that we essentially do not own the product despite all the sweat we pour into it; we are instead a part of a larger community that comes together to build a widely suitable, sustainable and inclusive product. \r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n  <h3>Appreciation</h3>\r\n  <p>\r\n  Through building this leaderboard for Layer5’s Community Forum, we have assimilated ourselves into the glorious match of soldiers that previously intimidated us. We stepped foot into the previously deemed insidious territory of open source contribution and realised that we too have a lot to offer in this ecosystem. \r\n  </p>\r\n  <p>\r\n  We have discovered a community of competent, supportive and serial problem-solvers, right from our mentors: \r\n  </p>\r\n  <ul>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <Link to=\"https://layer5.io/community/members/ekene-leonard-nwobodo\"><img src={meshmate} style={{height: \"1.25rem\"}} /> Ekene Leonard Nwobodo</Link>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/etienejames5\">Etiene James</a>\r\n    </li>\r\n    <li>\r\n      <Link to=\"/community/members/ruth-ikegah\">Ruth Ikegah</Link>\r\n    </li>\r\n     <li>\r\n      <Link to=\"/community/members/atinuke-oluwabamikemi-kayode\">Oluwabamikemi Kayode</Link>\r\n    </li>\r\n  </ul>\r\n  <p>\r\n   to the entirety of the contributors, a knowledge powerhouse that we look forward to continue contributing and building towards.\r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n  <p>\r\n  Additionally, we would like to convey hearty regards to <a href=\"https://shecodeafrica.org/\">She Code Africa</a> for availing this program as a stepping stone to women like us to get started in OSS. Their clarity in mission and vision execution and elaborate support structure has given a significant lift to women in Tech and curated a place where they can receive mentorship and the intellectual stimulation that necessitates and inevitably culminates to growth. \r\n  </p>\r\n\r\n</BlogWrapper>\r\n","frontmatter":{"title":"8 Weeks of Open Source Contribution with Layer5","date":"Jun 7th, 2022","author":"Ednah Akoth & Oyin Dawodu","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRgYBAABXRUJQVlA4IPoAAACwBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpE0oJSOiKA1RABoJbACdL8JLA7AawLgEJUu1oG/8VqhBxNLD/6xY5QAA+GNTNuzYeCqf0KGmw+WANz2VbD75vWZ1/xthsSLZyp8VFejLxsmsjQk3Ru4p01AnMqeTxYnFtbsPTfbCTrToINiKXPQ44kBmb+/98B4irWb/Q4pL0P/U8HXIH7zE6SCkzZL+dX5xeP2ZvCaZ7wPypBcDARYZEFLaF+nOw1ZvYg75QPef92MHfwP9zjDjw3RJuzn5mJF0kyM/0Z8U5rgqcbC6xqFA2rIfW/nSximAUBtPO18c99u+8YOyNfyVKhK4AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f506/sca-contributhon-2022.webp","srcSet":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f03f/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 750w,\n/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f506/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/sca-contributhon-2022.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRgYBAABXRUJQVlA4IPoAAACwBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpE0oJSOiKA1RABoJbACdL8JLA7AawLgEJUu1oG/8VqhBxNLD/6xY5QAA+GNTNuzYeCqf0KGmw+WANz2VbD75vWZ1/xthsSLZyp8VFejLxsmsjQk3Ru4p01AnMqeTxYnFtbsPTfbCTrToINiKXPQ44kBmb+/98B4irWb/Q4pL0P/U8HXIH7zE6SCkzZL+dX5xeP2ZvCaZ7wPypBcDARYZEFLaF+nOw1ZvYg75QPef92MHfwP9zjDjw3RJuzn5mJF0kyM/0Z8U5rgqcbC6xqFA2rIfW/nSximAUBtPO18c99u+8YOyNfyVKhK4AAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f506/sca-contributhon-2022.webp","srcSet":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f03f/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 750w,\n/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/4f506/sca-contributhon-2022.webp 1080w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ae87c830615609aa9732e359ce00ad5b/sca-contributhon-2022.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/8-weeks-of-open-source-contribution-with-layer5"}},{"id":"10d40198-40a0-5d1e-8617-a75e432b771e","body":"\n\n\n\n\nimport { PerfbytesPodcast } from \"./perfbytesPodcast\";\nimport ConsulDemo from \"./consul-docker-extension-demo.webp\"\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n<PerfbytesPodcast>\n\n<h2>Podcast Insights</h2>\n<p>Many questions were asked, answered, and a variety of topics were discussed. The story just gets better. This podcast goes deep into service meshes, load generators, circuit breaker, service mesh patterns in addition to a live demo of <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link> and more. Hosted by Henrik from Perfbytes and joined by Mark, <Link to=\"/community/members/lee-calcote\">Lee Calcote</Link> from Layer5 and Mrittika Ganguli from Intel. Tune in to find out more. Get answers to all community questions as a bonus.</p>\n\n<h3>What is a service mesh?</h3>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n<p>Service mesh is one of the solutions that helps you to route traffic within your cluster so as to expose your services outside the cluster. It is a solution to control how different parts of an application share data with one another. Unlike other systems for managing this communication, a service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer built right into an app. You have different options like the service type load balancer or using ingress but service mesh makes sense because it will manage a lot of features around your service to service communication.</p>\n</div>\n\nIn general, service meshes arose from the concept of proxies such as the NGINX proxy. Then Envoy was introduced by Lyft. Lyft had the architecture, and Google came along and created it. That gave us Istio, which is now part of CNCF. \n<Blockquote\n  quote=\"We were slugging it out in our labs trying to figure out how to do performance benchmarking with a service mesh. Instead of ten tools, if we had just one, it would be nice. Then we see Meshery come into the field\"\n  person=\"Mrittika\"\n/>\n\nService meshes, according to Lee, \"hit a real sweet spot personally\", having been focused on networking for most part of his career.\nHe believes that there are a couple of different ways to speak about the genesis of service meshes, with Linkerd being the first to coin the term.\nWe had Linkerd v1 written in scala and use jvm and then came Linkerd v2 which is something totally different at this point. It's all different code, different languages and  a different service mesh architecture. There's a number of different architectures by which service meshes are deployed. There's a new one that's been softly announced in beta from called Cilium that is helping bring back some of the different architectures of how to run the proxies.\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n<p>\nThe way I prefer to think about a surface mesh is that it's all about resiliency.\nIf you were to take a three-tiered web or three-tiered app and you think about how you're breaking out those tiers with some amount of\nkind of vertical scaling,  you'd probably, end up putting at least a virtual IP address out in front of the whole web tier and then you've got an app tier and a database tier because you've got multiple instances of those things. Maybe there's a load balancer in between.  This structure makes it simple to boost your resiliency.\n</p>\n</div>\n\nHenrik goes on to elaborate that in service mesh we can do a lot of things to make sure that the communication is reliable. \nWhen you design microservice architecture, there is a need of implementing retry logic. So if a service A needs to introduce another service B, then the service mesh will manage the retry logic such that if we reach at one time and the service B is not responding then the service mesh will try to reach out several times. Therefore a service mesh offers a variety of features like this to manage the certificates within the cluster and and circle them in a regular pace. You can also have traffic splitting if you do canary releases. In your service to service communication, there are a plethora of scenarios that the service mesh can handle.\nHenrik recalled that it's normally difficult to obtain a full view of what rules we've applied in the cluster, and when he first saw Meshery, his immediate thought was, \"Wow, this is exactly what is missing in the market at the moment.\"\n\n\nLets dig deeper into this tool we've been alluding to for a while now: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>.\n\n<h3>Meshery</h3>\nIf you were on a pager and were managing a large service mesh deployment with a number of rules and configurations around how security is enforced and identities are managed, and things like uniform observability and how metrics and logs are collected and enforced, and then the different traffic writing rules and stuff. You might soil myself if you had to go make a change in that sea of yaml. That's in part what we're working towards. There's a capability within Meshery for solving this challenge. As a cloud native management plane, Meshery presides over top of 10 different types of service meshes and it also presides over kubernetes. You can run it outside of kubernetes or inside of kubernetes.\n<p>\nMeshery has a number of components to its architecture. There is Meshery UI. It has a Mesheryctl, which is a CLI component. We have a number of service mesh adapters for each service mesh that Meshery supports.\n</p>\n\n<h5>What is the need for different adapters?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\nMeshery, as the multi-mesh manager, supports couple of different adapters. Adapters are used by Meshery to manage the numerous service meshes. Different service mesh adapters are written to expose the unique value of each service mesh. Consequently, they are not equally capable just as each service mesh is not equally capable as the other. Some of them work in a similar way. Some of the service meshes have their own differentiated value, which is why there are individual adapters. Some of them work slightly differently depending on whether they're running as a managed service or not.\n</div>\n\n\nWe have a plug-in for Meshery it's called <Link to=\"/meshmap\">MeshMap</Link>, it is what you might consider a visual topology. It has a lot of use cases for observing in kind of a read-only mode. There's a second mode to this tool: The Designer Mode. It's a visual configurator of not only the specific settings within any of those service meshes that it supports like a circuit breaker and adjusting the sensor video\nbut also end up being a visual designer for your kubernetes deployments. When users drop in, they're able to go over and grab the specific capabilities of any of those service mesh adapters that are loaded for any of the versions of that mesh that they might want to design. The concept here is that they drag and drop these capabilities over and there's a bit of discoverability that's afforded through this ui rather than parsing through yaml, trying to understand what's going on.\n\n<img src={ConsulDemo} alt=\"Consul MeshMap Demo\" className=\"slides-right\" />\n\nI like to pretend that I know a lot about service meshes, but when it comes to having to keep track of all of them, I don't know what the gateway tls sds config is, and so this type of inline help is quite useful to design your deployments. The deployments may or may not use a mesh; in fact, you can use this to create your Kubernetes configuration and deployment as well.  You can even save and recall those designs.\n\nTaking this example of consul, produced by hashicorp, is a little more of an\nintriguing deployment and a simple two-tier deck.  We announced the <Link to=\"/docker-extension-meshery\">Meshery Docker Extension</Link> recently. So if you're using docker desktop, Meshery will be a first class app that's available inside of market and part of what it does as it integrates with docker desktop is it will import docker compose apps convert them to kubernetes manifests or kubernetes apps and they'll let you deploy those formerly docker compose apps onto a mesh which is why I'm talking about a two-tiered service.\n\n<h5>Does MeshMap allow you to load the current configuration that is has been applied in the current cluster?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\nCurrently, there are two modes: the one we were looking at before was the designer mode, and the one we'll be looking at now is the visualizer mode, which is probably a little more of an it's not entirely read-only to the extent that you could grab a pod and start an interactive session with the containers in that pod or you could you start a logging session. You could also initiate a performance test against  that particular service or that particular endpoint. \nMeshery supports three different types of load generators, which is a nighthawk, fortio and wrk2. \n</div>\n\n<h5>What are the capabilities of these three load generators? When you speak about service mesh testing or performance testing, what is actually the process behind the scene? What should users think about when they're starting a gig and need to configure and optimize the service mesh?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n<p>Lee expounds on that for our benefit. \nIt takes weeks to months that you've got to dedicate for performance engineers to go over and like pull together various tools and scripts around them to then get into a spreadsheet or into some database that you then generate results. \nThe genesis of Meshery part was to help people comprehend what a service mesh is, when to use one and which one to use?  As you go to explain these common questions, the real answer is a totally disappointing, which is, it just depends on what you're asking to do.  </p>\n<p>\nPeople want to measure it in cold hard quantitative metrics but if you're asking to do 100 percent sampling then also consider the distributed tracing implementation you had somewhere else and the fact that you're getting it\nin a uniform way here. Maybe you're likely to consider the overhead that you would have over there. It's frustrating to be trying to explain stuff to folks and get them excited about the tech and and to give them a vague response. Instead we give them a tool that says \"Hey look here's a tool that will deploy any of the service meshes that you want to test out.\" \n</p>\n<p>\nThere's a reason why there's ten of them like and actually many more than that.\nThere's a lot of overlap between them but different tools for different purposes for different size orgs, so it would be inappropriate to say well you know here's the one. It's rather hey here's a tool that that lets you deploy any number of them quickly, answer your own question about performance, because we can pump out benchmarks of the various service meshes under various configurations, using different types of workloads but which may or may not match your environment and over time those reports are going to get stale and so rather he's a tool to make you empowered.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<h5>Do you actually generate traffic that will go through the sidecar proxy of the service and then reach out the actual service?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\nThat load is generated on demand or on schedule against one or more endpoints, one or more of your services or something that is not even on your service. You can generate load not only against something running within your infrastructure but something external as well to do statistical analysis based on the configuration that you gave it and so yeah the answer is yes the traffic flows through the sidecar.\n</div>\n\n<h5>If I say I have never scripted or built any scenarios for fortio or nighthawk. Let's say I'm a loadrunner, a neoload, or a k6 user, and I want to accomplish the same thing with them. So what is the journey on those load generator? is it the same thing you have to build a workflow of requests that you want to send in that scenario?</h5>\n<div className=\"answer\">\n<p>That leads us to probably talk about one of our other projects which is called <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">Service Mesh Performance</Link> which is a specification. It's another one of the projects that we've donated to the CNCF. Service Mesh Performance is the spec while Meshery is an implementation of the spec. At a high level, if those other load generators were to adhere to how we standardize and describe the test that you want to run and then hand off that configuration to generate the performance profiles that are created here  you're not gonna down download them but the descriptor is important.</p>\nThis implements a standard for the industry on what is the actual\nservice mesh test and then standardize the format so then anyone can use the same format to design their script or whatever they want and then use it to test. \nSo when I build a script, and I don't know loadrunner today and I want to use neologo tomorrow, then I don't have to rewrite everything.

Not sure why your Envoy configuration isn't working? If you're using Istio as your gateway and need to troubleshoot your ingress traffic requests, here are a few tips for debugging Envoy proxy.\n</p>\n<h2>Enable Envoy Debug Logging</h2>\n<p>\n  By default Envoy system logs are sent to <code>/dev/stderr</code>. This location be overridden using <code>--log-path</code>. Logging to <code>/dev/stderr</code>  for system logs and to <code>/dev/stdout</code> for access logs can be useful when running Envoy inside a container. In this way, these two individual logstreams can be separated, and using this approach, logging requires no additional files or directories to be mounted.\n</p>\n<div className=\"intro\">\n<p>\n  We recommend setting the Envoy proxy’s log level to debug in a pre-production environment. Debug logs can help you identify issues before you graduate the associated configuration to your production environment.\n</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Using envoy CLI</h3>\n<p>\n  The envoy command has a <code>--log-level</code> flag that can be useful for debugging. By default, it’s set to info. To change it to debug, edit the envoy DaemonSet in the istio-system namespace and replace the <code>--log-level info</code> flag with <code>--log-level debug</code>. Setting the Envoy log level to debug can be particilarly useful for debugging TLS connection failures.\n</p>\n<h3>Using container image</h3>\n<p>\n  If you’re using the Envoy image, you can set the log level to debug through the <code>ENVOY_LOG_LEVEL</code> environment variable. The log level for Envoy system logs can be set using the <code>-l</code> or <code>--log-level</code> option.\n</p>\n\nThe available log levels are:\n\n<ul>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{width: \"fitContent\"}}>trace</li>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{width: \"fitContent\"}}>debug</li>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{width: \"fitContent\"}}>info</li>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{width: \"fitContent\"}}>warning/warn</li>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{width: \"fitContent\"}}>error</li>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{width: \"fitContent\"}}>critical</li>\n  <li className=\"highlight\" style={{width: \"fitContent\"}}>off</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe default is <span className=\"highlight\">info</span>.\n\n<h3>Setting Envoy logs in the Helm configuration</h3>\n\n<p>\n  The Consul helm chart uses <code>envoyExtraArgs:</code> to leverage Envoy command line options. One of the helpful options is <code>--component-log-level</code>. This provides granular control over setting log levels for Envoy components. In the example below, the components upstream, http, router and config are set to the debug log level. These four components are vital when debugging issues with requests between your services(sidecar proxies).\n</p>\n\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>connectInject:\n  enabled: true\n  envoyExtraArgs: \"--component-log-level upstream:debug,http:debug,router:debug,config:debug\"</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  If you haven't set envoyExtraArgs: in consul-values.yaml just yet, you can set the log levels on the fly by using the following kubectl command:\n</p>\n\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ kubectl exec pod/pod-name -c container-name -- curl -X POST http://localhost:19000/logging?config=debug</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>Example:</p>\n\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ kubectl exec pod/static-client-5bf4575d9c-zr2b -c static-client -- curl -X POST  http://localhost:19000/logging?config=debug</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  You will execute the kubectl command for each component. Make sure to append the correct component at the end of the curl command, i.e. <code>logging? component = debug</code>.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  If curl is not able to be used in your pod, you can alternatively use <code>kubectl port-forward pod-name 19000</code> to make the Envoy admin accessible. From another terminal window, you can then curl to change the log levels. The output you receive in the terminal will show the modified component log levels.\n</p>\n\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ curl -X POST http://localhost:19000/logging? component = debug</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n<h3>Access Envoy logs in Kubernetes</h3>\n\n<p>Accessing Envoy logs via pods can be done with the following command:</p>\n\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ kubectl logs --follow pod/ pod-name -c envoy-sidecar</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>The --follow flag provides a real time observation into Envoy logs. </p>\n\n<h3>Setting and Accessing Envoy logs when not using Helm.</h3>\n\n<p>The following command will start an envoy side car proxy, set the log level to debug with -l debug and capture Envoy logs in envoy_logs.txt. The .txt file will need to be created before executing this command.</p>\n\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ consul connect envoy -sidecar-for counting-1 -- -l debug --log-path envoy_logs.txt</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>To have granular control over the Envoy components that is needed to be debugged, use the following command:</p>\n\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ consul connect envoy -sidecar-for counting-1 -- --log-path envoy_logs.txt --component-log-level upstream:debug,http:debug,router:debug,config:debug</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Find your Istio Ingress Gateway</h2>\n<p>\n  With Istio as your gateway, you should first look at <code>VirtualService</code> objects. These can show if the hosts are registered to the gateway correctly.\n</p>\n\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>$ kubectl get virtualservice -o=yaml</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  However, sometimes, the <a  className=\"highlight\" href=\"https://envoyproxy.io\">Envoy</a> inside the gateway container is not properly configured (likely due to a bug). You can dump Envoy configuration to debug this further.\n</p>\n\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code># find istio ingress gateway pod \\\n      $ kubectl get pods -n istio-system -l app=istio-ingressgateway</code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n\n<p>\n  Let's use <code>istio-ingressgateway-a93019f9dfw-l39xd</code> as an example pod name.\n</p>\n\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>\n      # enable debugging on envoy \\\n      $ kubectl exec --namespace=istio-system \\\n      istio-ingressgateway-a93019f9dfw-l39xd \\\n      -c istio-proxy -- curl -X POST \\\n      http://localhost:15000/logging?level=debug\n    </code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n<p>\n  Then, use <code>istioctl</code> tool to dump route configuration (this will show the output from the <a href=\"https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/admin#operations-admin-interface-config-dump\"><code>/config_dump</code> admin endpoint</a> on Envoy):\n</p>\n<div>\n  <pre>\n    <code>\n    $ istioctl proxy-config routes -n istio-system -o=json \\\n      istio-ingressgateway-a93019f9dfw-l39xd\n    </code>\n  </pre>\n</div>\n<p>\n  We hope these steps are useful to you.

By converting performance measurements into insights about the value of individual, cloud native application networking functions, MeshMark distills a variety of overhead signals and key performance indicators into a simple index. \n</p>\n\n<img src={performanceQuestion}  alt=\"Developers need to access service mesh\" style={{width: \"50%\", float: \"right\"}} />\n<p>\n<h3>Talk started with a question to audience: Missing performance characteristics?</h3>\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    <Blockquote className=\"pull-left\"\n    quote=\"We are missing some performance characteristics, as people has many metrics used to track environments it might take a while to articulate the characteristics performance of your environment.\"\n    person=\"Lee Calcote\"\n    />\n</p>    \n\n<h3>Lee Calcote explains about \"Business Performance\"</h3>\n\n<p>\nWe're quite frequently overlooking business performance, which is in large respect to why we're running the infrastructure in the first place. We usually talk about performance and cold, hard, quantitative speeds and feeds, but instead, I would submit to you that performance should absolutely be measured in terms of speeds and feeds, but it's a lot more meaningful to layer in the value and to quantify\nthe value that your infrastructure is providing. So we're really kind of missing the business performance aspects of what we're tracking, how we're characterizing.\n</p>    \n\n\n<img src={smp}  alt=\"Developers need to access service mesh\" style={{width: \"50%\", float: \"right\"}} />\n<h3>Introduction to Service Mesh Performance</h3>\n\n<p>\n    The Service Mesh Performance project falls under the umbrella of CNCF project. This project is, at its core, probably a specification for capturing the details of your environment in a uniform way, in a consistent way,\n    capturing your infrastructure configuration, your service mesh configuration, and characterizing the details of your workloads and doing so consistently such that you can baseline your environments.\n    You can benchmark them in a consistent way, share with others, maybe compare with the performance that others are having. To the extent that it's codified, you can have system to system exchange of this information.\n</p>\n\n\n<h2>Mrittika Ganguli introduces MeshMark with an example</h2>\n\n<p>\n    MeshMark is a Cloud Native value measurement, from value you are essentially trying to measure if the performance of your infrastructure matches what you want to get from your deployment,\n    what kind of value you want to get, business value you want to get from your deployment. So, for example, if you have some key performance indicators, do you want to measure whether the MeshMark value is directly responsible for how your video gets loaded or your image gets loaded on a particular webpage.\n    <p>\n    <Blockquote className=\"pull-right\"\n    quote=\"Are my resources utilized as best as possible? Why am I not getting the SLO met with 4 resources when I only needed 1 resource without the service mesh? How can I improve my 99.9% latencies or can I map my service policy to utilization? Is the network a performance hog, or storage, or cache? Meshmark intends to help model and provide an index for many of these areas\"\n    person=\"Mrittika Ganguli\"\n    />\n    So often you see when you have a YouTube video uploaded, it will have only the text and not the video. \n</p>   \n    And so what happens is you do not want that kind of an experience. You want the video to be and the images to be loaded first. As you can see in video if you click on something, you may often see the text get rendered first and then the video.\n    The load latency of the video traffic is what impacts you see visually. And so the deployment of your cloud native environment. If it can be indexed through a MeshMark ratio, your load latency will be directly proportional to that and then the number of resources you're using to deploy this environment to get a particular lower latency or a higher latency is a usage metric and that's directly proportional to your MeshMark.\n    The TCO of your application hence becomes directly related to MeshMark.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n<img src={meshmarkSlide} className=\"slides\" align=\"center\" style={{marginLeft: \"30px\"}} alt=\"meshmark\" />\n<img src={example} className=\"slides\" align=\"center\" style={{marginLeft: \"30px\"}} alt=\"meshmark example\" />\n</p>\n\n<img src={formula} alt=\"MeshMark formula\" style={{width: \"50%\", float: \"right\"}} />\n<h2>MeshMark The Formula</h2>\n<p>\n    MeshMark functions as a value performance index (a scale) to provide organizations  the ability to weigh the value of their service mesh versus the overhead of their service mesh and assess whether they are getting out of the mesh what they are “paying” for in it. MeshMark’s scoring system ranges from 0 to 100 and incorporates collections of resource utilization efficiency calculations, categorized into similar consumption classes.\n</p>\n\n<h3>Mrittika explains MUE</h3>\n<p>\n    It's a calculation, combined ratio of measured platform resources to assign resources. If you're able to measure what your assigned resources are in whatever form and able to also monitor what's the used resources, you can have this ratio. So, for example, a very simple one is CPU performance. \n    <img src={MUE} alt=\"MeshMark MUE\" style={{width: \"50%\", float: \"left\", paddingRight: \"1rem\"}} /> And you would want to see if the CPU performance as a ratio to the available resources is a loss or a gain. So CPU performance, raw loss over total CPU is our MUE one.\n    And that's just one minus CPU utilization over 100. That's a very simple ratio and if you see on the slide, the graph shows you that as the latency increases, your Mue lowers. And so that's a very good indicator that your efficiency of your infrastructure is not very good because your latencies are increasing as your QPS increases.\n    So like this you can measure and create other MUEs. We will look at how you can visualize this within an environment and so let's look at the demonstration. So let's jump into a sibling CNCF project called Meshery.\n    Meshery is a cloud native management plane. Users of Meshery can configure their Kubernetes deployments any and every service mesh as well as on board and off board their workloads onto any given mesh.\n</p>    \n\n<img src={MeshMapDemo} alt=\"MeshMap demo\" style={{width: \"40%\", float: \"right\"}}  />\n<h3>Lee demonstrates MeshMap with an example Consul application</h3>\n\n<p>\nLet's take an example workload a  Consul application, load it into the visual designer, take a look at the service splitting functionality of console and note in this case we're assigning a weight of three when we can change that to four to derive its MeshMark which is a mesh utilization efficiency calculation of the efficiency by which that network function is being performed.\nWe could also take a look at service intentions of console and examine the efficiency of that network function. Now that you've seen the demo you want to go ahead and publish the results and call everyone to get together.\n</p>    \n\n<div style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>\n<iframe width=\"70%\" height=\"450px\"  style={{marginRight: \"1.5rem\", marginLeft: \"1.5rem\"}} src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yvqn6ckO7BI\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n<p style={{fontStyle: \"italic\", fontSize: \"1rem\", marginLeft: \"1rem\"}}>MeshMark in Meshery (an excerpt from ServiceMeshCon EU 2022 demo)</p>\n</div>\n\n<p><strong>Lee Calcote and Mrittika Ganguli covered all the concepts of SMP and MeshMark in this great talk.

Cloud native architectures call for horizontally scalable, distributed systems design with microservices proliferated from Cloud to Edge. Technical Advisory Group (TAG) Network’s objective is to enable widespread and effective development, deployment, and operation of resilient and intelligent network systems in cloud native environments, keeping an eye on the needs of workloads, developers who design them, and operators who manage them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Lee Calcote (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lcalcote\">@lcalcote</a>) is an innovative product and technology leader, passionate about empowering engineers and enabling organizations. As the founder and CEO of Layer5, he is at the forefront of the cloud native movement. Ken Owens (<a href =\"https://twitter.com/kenowens12\">@kenowens12</a>) is the Vice President, Cyber Cloud Security Engineering at FISERV. Owens is a technologist and an innovator with more than 20+ years of experience in a plethora of technologies and has been championing the cloud native movement for more than a decade now. \n</p>\n<p>\n    As an introduction to TAG Network, Owens  describes  the group’s  core objectives and reasons for its formation, summarized below:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Listening to ideas and collaborations</li>\n<li>Assisting and attracting projects</li>\n<li>Building communities and providing impartial stewardship</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Calcote and Owens are frequently asked a common question <em>“Is it important for the organization to be a part of CNCF to participate in the TAG Network group?”</em>. Owens emphasizes that anyone can participate, regardless of whether or not their company is a CNCF member organization. It does not require any payment and is an open-source effort in its spirit.\n</p>\n<h3>CNCF TAG Network Projects and various stages they go through:</h3>\n<img src={Projects} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"center\" alt=\"Tag Networks Projects\" />\n\n<p>\n    One of the important goals of the TAG Network is to identify the unique projects that want to participate and shepherd their journey through CNCF project levels. Project-fit and the process of assessment for inclusion in the CNCF require your project to be on terms with the following essential traits:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uniqueness</li>\n<li>Problem it solves</li>\n<li>Value it brings to the community</li> \n<li>Market demand</li>\n<li>Diversification </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    Creating and stewarding any one of these projects is a significant undertaking. The  project's maintainers pitch the project and explicate how their project meets the above traits. \n</p>\n<p>\n    You start in a sandbox and work your way up to an incubation area once you've demonstrated a fundamental interest and understanding of the space, as well as some adoption. To graduate, the project must satisfy the required traits, be open-source, provide value and solve a problem effectively. We don't want to promote a CNCF project that is solely driven by one source. Diversification is crucial to the core of any CNCF project. Owens shared a subtle analogy, <em>\"a truly open source project is one in which contributors belong to the companies A+B+C...Z instead of just company A\"</em> \n</p>\n\n\n<h4>Working Groups and papers, and how they work.</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Universal Data Plane API and Service Mesh WG are the two working groups stewarded by TAG Network.</li>\n<li>They utilize Kubecon to educate about the functioning of working groups.</li>\n<li>Whitepapers and publications are carried out by working group members. A Recent publication was published in the IEEE Bridge magazine, entitled <Link to=\"/resources/service-mesh-performance/analyzing-service-mesh-performance\">Analyzing Service Mesh Performance</Link>.</li>\n<li>Further goals include getting into the IEEE Communications Society and publishing an article entitled Techniques of Service Mesh Optimization.</li>\n</ul>\n\nThe majority of the more detailed activities occur in the CNCF Service Mesh Working Group - a subgroup of TAG Network. The deep-dive unveiled many individual initiatives, the majority of which have a common thread: <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>. Meshery is the cloud native management plane that enables the adoption, operation, and management of workloads.\n\n<p>\n    It's a Meshy world out there! As the ubiquity of service meshes unfolds and they become a commonplace for any cloud native or edge environment, so does the need for vendor and technology-agnostic interfaces to interact with them. Calcote gives us a walkthrough of two Service Mesh Specifications:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li><b><Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">Service Mesh Interface (SMI):</Link></b> SMI focuses on the interoperability of the various features of a service mesh.</li>\n<li><b><Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">Service Mesh Performance (SMP):</Link></b> SMP tries to make it uniform and succinct the way you characterize the performance of cloud native infrastructure with a focus on service meshes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n<img src={Smi} className=\"slides\" align=\"center\" style={{marginLeft: \"10px\"}} alt=\"SMI\" />\n<img src={Smp} className=\"slides\" align=\"center\" style={{marginLeft: \"10px\"}} alt=\"SMP\" />\n</p>\n\n<p>\n    Owens and Calcote also discuss <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books/service-mesh-patterns\">Service Mesh Patterns</Link> and Service Mesh Catalog. These patterns promote the reuse of best practices, are service mesh agnostic, and also help in behavior analysis. A circuit breaker test is a good example.  If something goes wrong in your network be it a node failure, router failure, etc., then it helps you identify the point of failure as well as gets your network running quickly. \n</p>\n<img src={Catalog} className=\"slides\" alt=\"Service Mesh Catalog\" style={{display: \"block\", margin: \"0 auto 1.5rem\", width: \"60%\"}}/>\n\n\n<p>\n    Talking about distributed systems, we come across the problem of distributed analysis. In this talk, the TAG Network co-chairs help us understand this problem and why we must worry about it.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many performance characterizing tools are limited to single instance load generators. This limits the amount of traffic and the variety of behavioral analysis.</li>\n<li>Distributed load testing in parallel poses a challenge when merging results without losing the precision we need to gain insight into the high tail percentiles.</li>\n<li>How to model your service mesh topology and optimize for your ideal configuration in context of how much you value properties of resiliency, performance, throughput, latency, and so on before deploying to production. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n    This brings us to <Link to=\"/projects/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</Link> and <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>. Together they help produce robust, distributed and scalable services. Distributed load testing offers insight into system behaviors that accurately represent real world behaviors of services under load as that load comes from any number of sources.\n</p>\n<img src={Gnh} className=\"slides\" style={{display: \"block\", margin: \"0 auto 1.5rem\", width: \"60%\"}} alt=\"GetNighthawk\" />\n\n<p><strong>Calcote and Owens packed a great deal of information in this talk.

Unit and integration tests bolster and roll up into broader end-to-end, functional testing performed across Meshery and the rest of its components. </p>\n\n<p>High levels of code coverage makes it easier for each project contributor to be confident that their code changes aren’t breaking any preexisting <code>mesheryctl</code> commands, side-swiping their functionality unknowingly, and consequently, unwittingly lowering the quality of Meshery's overall user experience.</p>\n\n<h3> mesheryctl lines of code</h3>\n\n\n```yaml\n\n    270 text files.\n    106 unique files.\n    166 files ignored.\n\n    cloc v 1.92  T=0.15 s (692.3 files/s, 110063.3 lines/s)\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Language       files          blank        comment           code\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Go                88           2128           1330          13045\n    YAML              12              0              0            215\n    JSON               4              0              0             42\n    make               1             10              2             31\n    Markdown           1             23              0             27\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    SUM:             106           2161           1332          13360\n    ------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\n<p>Unit Tests can be written in two ways:</p>\n\n<ol>\n    <li>\n        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand\n        <ol>\n            <li>Mock Meshery(backend) response if needed</li>\n            <li>Grab console output</li>\n            <li>Store standard/verified mesheryctl output in a golden file(a text file)</li>\n            <li>Match the stored/expected output with what we grab from the console</li>\n            <li>Cover as many scenarios as possible, test the situations where errors must be thrown</li>\n            <li>This is a standard format, changes can be made accordingly</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n    <li>\n        Test <code>mesheryctl</code> functions\n        <ol>\n            <li>This is the standard testing you may have come across in every project</li>\n            <li>You write one test dedicated to one function covering all possible test-cases, matching expected outputs</li>\n        </ol>\n    </li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>Example tree graph</h3>\n<p>This example of a tree graph (from <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pull/4823\">meshery/meshery/pull/4823</a>) shows the impact given changes make on the level of code coverage.</p>\n\n<img src={TreeGraph} />\n\n<h3>Integration Tests</h3>\n\n<p>Integrations tests come into view when you cannot mock something easily and when a given behavior is cross-functional / cross-component. Integration tests put more, but not all of the focus validating system behavior and that the system completes all the necessary actions. Take <code>mesheryctl system start</code> for example. This command deploys Meshery, its adapters, and Kubernetes Operator; it starts Meshery. So, you run the command to start Meshery in a GitHub workflow and after running the <code>mesheryctl</code> subcommand through the tests and make sure that Meshery actually started. And if the workflow successfully runs the test, then boom!, you aced your integration writing test... errr... test writing.</p>\n\n<p>The integration test writing exam can initially be challenging, but... that’s the fun in it. :) Running tests and making sure a command that is otherwise hard to verify, hard to test, and making it automatic through GH workflows.</p>\n\n<h3>How you can make an impact</h3>\n\n<p>Writing tests and making them work is in itself a tough task to do, so writing one test for a single function counts and makes a big difference over the long term. Don't hesitate. Start writing tests now. A single, new test is worthy of raising a pull request and will get you well on your way to learning much more about Golang, Docker, Kubernetes, and service meshes.</p>\n\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://codecov.io/gh/meshery/meshery/\">Codecov</a> is used to check code coverage in <code>mesheryctl</code> (login with GitHub to get an in-depth idea of lines-of-code being covered in code coverage).</li>\n    <li>You can check the files on CodeCov’s website to figure out which mesheryctl commands haven’t been covered by existing tests.</li>\n    <li>Guide: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xRlFpElRmybJ3WacgPKXgCSiQ2poJl3iCCV1dAalf0k/edit#heading=h.rzpmb66db1sq\">Writing tests for mesheryctl</a>. This guide will briefly introduce how tests are supposed to be written for mesheryctl.</li>\n    <li>Contributing to Tests doesn’t always mean writing new tests, It also means improving the effectiveness of already written-ones.</li>\n    <li> Search for Issues marked with area/tests in <a href=\"https://github.com/meshery/meshery\">GitHub - meshery/meshery</a>: Meshery, the cloud native management plane.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The impact that you make with by writing even a single test is quite high. Your tests will be executed and used time-and-time again. I can’t explain in words (I don’t have that good of a vocabulary). Your Tests are going to run in each pull request raised against the Meshery project, in each commit someone pushes to a pull request, in every nightly regression test suite, in every release. Just think: if another contributor incidently introduces a defect or doesn't consider for an edge case, and fails to uphold the intended behavior of the code, your tests are going to catch them redhanded. How cool is that?</p>\n\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? Jump in and write a few tests today! When you raise your pull request, label it with <code>area/tests</code> and <code>component/mesheryctl</code> and I'll be there to review!

A service mesh data plane is the collection of intelligent proxies that\n  operate in unison under the coordination of the control plane.

In this talk, he walked through service mesh specifications and why they matter in your deployment.\n   How many service mesh specifications do you know? He went through all of them. So, no worries if you're unfamiliar.\n  </p>\n</div>   \n\n### Service Mesh Specifications:\n<img src={Abstractions} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"abstractions\" />\n\nAs the ubiquity of service meshes unfolds and they become a commonplace for any cloud native or edge environment, so does the need for vendor and technology-agnostic interfaces to interact with them. The Service Mesh Interface (SMI), the Service Mesh Performance (SMP), and Multi-Vendor Service Mesh Interoperation (Hamlet) are three open specifications solving the challenge of interoperability, workload and performance management between service meshes. \n\nLearn what makes each of them unique and why they are much needed. See each of these three specifications in action as we use Meshery, the open-source service mesh management plane to demonstrate the value and functionality of each service mesh abstraction, and the adherence of these specifications by Istio, Linkerd, Consul and other popular service meshes.\n\n### Cloud native Journey to service meshes:\n\n<img src={Journey} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"journey-image\" />\n\nThe advent of cloud native was the popularization of containers. Thank you Docker! From there, containers took off like wildfire. Turns out you need an orchestrator to wrangle that sprawl. We saw a number of orchestrators come and we still have a number of orchestrators around.\n\nService meshes have become a hot topic in the last few years. They still continue to be, rightfully so, a very powerful piece of technology. “A lot of the power is yet to come from my perspective. For my part, I believe that there is a tomorrow in which data plane intelligence really matters. And matters about how people write cloud native applications.”, Lee emphasized. Not everyone quite understands the capabilities of meshes as they are promoted and spoken about today. So come along into the journey of service mesh.\n\nThere are a number of service meshes out there. One of the community projects is to track the landscape of all of the meshes there are. There’s a lot to say about each of them, their architecture, and their working. Why are they made? Who are they focused on? What do they do? When did they come about? Why are some of them not here anymore? Why are we still seeing new ones? A lot of things to go through. You might be interested in any number of the details that the landscape tracks.\n <div className=\"note\">Be Aware, It's Meshy Out There!</div>\n\n### Service Mesh Interface\n<img src={SMI} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"smi-image\" />\n<ul>\n    <li>Its goal and genesis were born inside of Kubernetes.</li>\n    <li> Being a specification that is native to Kubernetes, its focus is on lowest common denominator functionality.</li>\n    <li> The focus on bringing forth APIs that highlight and reinforce the most common use cases that service meshes are being used for currently</li>\n    <li>Leaves space and provides extensibility room for additional APIs to address other service mesh functionality as more people adopt and make use cases well known.</li>\n    <li>There are seven service meshes that claim compatibility with SMI. There's been a community effort, open-source effort to create service mesh conformance tests to assert whether or not a given service mesh is compatible with SMI</li>\n    <li> In order to facilitate those types of tests, you need to have a tool to provision a sample application on those services which will generate load and test whether traffic splitting behaves as expected or works with that service mesh implementation properly.</li>\n    <li>Then you need to be able to collect the results, guarantee the provenance of those results and publish them.</li>\n    <li> As a community, we turned to Meshery as the tool to implement <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI conformance</Link> and we have been working with the individual service meshes to validate their conformance. </li>\n</ul>    \n<b>Meshery</b>\n<ul>\n  <li> We work on an open-source project called <Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>.</li>\n  <li> Meshery, the cloud native management plane, is the canonical implementation of the service mesh performance.</li>\n  <li>The management planes can do a number of things to help bridge the divide between other back-end systems and service meshes. They also help performance management, configuration management, making sure you are following best practices in your implementations by taking common patterns and applying them to your environment </li>\n</ul>\nLet's take a moment to demo what it looks like to validate conformance in SMI using Meshery.\n\n<img src={Graph} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"graph\" />\n<ul>\n   <li> We need to spin up Meshery locally</li>\n   <li> We use mesheryctl as the command line interface to work with Meshery.</li>\n   <li> We can interact with a number of different service mesh. The service mesh we’re going to work with today is an Open service mesh (one of those 7 that is compatible with SMI). Let’s put it to the test.</li>\n   <li> We'll initiate <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI conformance</Link></li>\n   <li>These tests go and do assertions across these different specifications. We’re looking at traffic access, traffic splitting, traffic specification. Meshery then collects these results and will eventually be publishing them in combination with the SMI project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n### Service Mesh Performance\n<img src={SMP} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"smp-image\" />\n<ul>\n    <li>Focused on describing and capturing the performance of a service mesh.</li>\n    <li>The overhead of the value is another way of looking at it and characterizing it.</li>\n    <li>Trying to characterize the performance of the infrastructure of a service mesh can be really difficult.</li>\n    <li>Considering the number of variables that you would have to track, how difficult it can be to have repeatable tests, and benchmark your environment, to track your history based on your environment, compare performance between other meshes people need.</li>\n    <li>SMP creates a standard way of capturing the performance of the mesh to help with these issues.</li>\n    <li>It's also the way in which you're configuring your control plan of your service mesh.</li>\n</ul>    \n\nYou might be using a client library to do some service mesh functionality. Maybe you're using those in combination with the service mesh. What costs more? What's more efficient? What's more powerful? Maybe you're using web assembly and filters there.\nThese are all open questions that <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">SMP</Link> assists in answering in your environment. You’d be surprised by some of the results of some tests that we have done and that the community has done in combination with a couple of universities and graduate students.\n\n<b>Performance Test</b>\n\nDemonstration of the implementation of service mesh Performance:\n\n<img src={Flowchart} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"flowchart\" />\n<ul>\n  <li> On the terminal, we have a local deployment of Meshery running. You can also deploy on Kubernetes as well as the vendor Kubernetes platforms like AKS, EKS and GCP or you can use a dockerized container to run Meshery. You can also have your Kubernetes on Docker desktop.</li>\n  <li>We have the Open service mesh deployed.</li>\n  <li> The Meshery UI is exposed at 9081 port. This is the UI which is used to instantiate a Load test.</li>\n  <li> Over here you can see we have 3 load generators fortio, wrk2, nighthawk.</li>\n  <li> All of these load generators have their own set of attributes which they record correctly and each of its attributes have their own significance. We begin with fortio.</li>\n  <img src={Bucket} className=\"slides-right\" align=\"right\" alt=\"graph\" />\n\n  <li> You can actually download the test results or you can just browse into the Results Tab and see all of the tests which you have run until now.</li>\n  <li>Next, we used nighthawk to generate the load and benchmark the service for the same. Nighthawk is a load generator which is maintained by the Envoy community and is relatively new. It still hasn't got its 1.0 release but right now Nighthawk has sufficient features to compete with different generators which are still in the play. It can generate a gRPC service on its own and it has some more attributes which you can expose using their CLI tools.</li>\n  <li> You can also see that Meshery has the capability to search your environment, see what specifications are being used and what's the load on your Kubernetes.</li>\n  <li>Jump into the results Tab and see how we compare with these results.</li>\n  <li>You can click on the download. You will see that a yaml gets downloaded in which you can browse and see that the start time, load time, the performance latencies, the metrics are being captured.</li>\n</ul>  \n\n### Hamlet or Multi-vendor Service Mesh Interoperation\n<img src={Hamlet} className=\"slides-left\" align=\"left\" alt=\"hamlet-image\" />\n<ul>\n  <li>Focus on service mesh federation</li>\n  <li>Specifies a set of API standards for enabling service mesh federation</li>\n  <li>Hamlet takes on a client-server architecture in which resources and services of one service mesh are discovered, registered and using a common format, information about them is exchanged between different service mesh.</li>\n  <li>Rules around authentication and authorization rules around which Services get exposed and to whom and who can communicate with them and whether or not they can do it securely. These are things that Hamlet addresses.</li>\n  <li>\n  The specification currently consists of two APIs:\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>The Federated Resource Discovery API</strong>: API to authenticate and securely distribute resources between federated service meshes.</li>\n      <li>The <strong>Federated Service Discovery API</strong>: API to discover, reach, authenticate and securely communicate with federated services.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Part of the real power is the ability to overcome what are likely to be separate administrative domains. The intention here is to marry up connect two disparate service mesh deployments, those deployments might be of the same type, they might be of two different types.</li>\n</ul>\n\nIn addition to SMI, SMP and Hamlet there has been an emergence of service mesh patterns, by which people are running and operating service meshes. There is a service mesh working group under CNCFs network that is helping identify those patterns of which there's a list right now unbeknownst to you. Reach out, join it, help us work through the 60 patterns that are defined right now. 30 of those are going into an <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books\">O’Reilly</Link> book called <Link to=\"/learn/service-mesh-books/service-mesh-patterns\">Service Mesh Patterns</Link>.\n\nSomething that isn’t always obvious to folks is this piece of value that people get from a service mesh and actually from the specifications that we were just mentioning. It is the fact that teams are decoupled when you’re running a mesh. Developers get to iterate a bit independently of operators, and so do operators get to make changes to implement infrastructure to the way that applications behave independent of developers in the presence of a mesh.  Both of these teams are significantly empowered. Everybody gets a piece of power when they deploy a mesh.\n\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite  come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Service Mesh Specifications and Why They Matter","date":"Sep 20th, 2021","author":"Debopriya Bhattacharjee","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoR3N4AAWScxK3A0AAD+y+7TltDm8faWnWkrgNwKEaB+a5F7h6kfv+PNmIbiHtDLJbrKy70mpaSz/NUvAS+UKSii+WgoY4/+Ld6wAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/a66aa/Cover-image.webp 750w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/65dd5/Cover-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/f9724/Cover-image.webp 1366w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5630208333333334}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/Cover-image.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJbACdMoR3N4AAWScxK3A0AAD+y+7TltDm8faWnWkrgNwKEaB+a5F7h6kfv+PNmIbiHtDLJbrKy70mpaSz/NUvAS+UKSii+WgoY4/+Ld6wAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/a66aa/Cover-image.webp 750w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/65dd5/Cover-image.webp 1080w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/f9724/Cover-image.webp 1366w,\n/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/92e8b/Cover-image.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5630208333333334}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9e70b0d102359852501532eaf88c857/Cover-image.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/service-mesh-specifications/service-mesh-specifications-and-why-they-matter"}},{"id":"6b3908f1-2736-5322-a4e3-c3e864fd6d66","body":"\n\n\nimport Nithish from \"./nithish-karthik.webp\";\nimport Ashish from \"./ashish-tiwari.webp\";\nimport Rudraksh from \"./rudraksh-pareek.webp\";\nimport Bariq from \"./bariq-nurlis.webp\";\n\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n{\" \"}\n\n<div className=\"intro\">\n  <p>\n    Layer5 participates in many\n    <Link className=\"blog\" to=\"/careers/programs\">{\" \"}open source internship programs</Link>.

Like how most people formulate what and how they will do in the uni, I also came from normalcy. In Singapore, students are aiming to get the best mark in every possible lesson in college as our grades hold a very high importance in the culture. Going back and forth between classes, planning a startup with my peers, volunteering in community clubs, I had a spectacular two years in uni.\n  </p>\n<p>\nHowever, during the last summer break, I started asking myself questions. How should I be better? What should I do? When should I do it? As I got more familiar with the Uni and all my messes (like clubs and tech-stacks that I used), I was in my comfort zone. From my experience, once you know that you’re in a comfort zone, that is exactly when you should start taking actions. Then, I found out the concept of open source. I know that I could hone my skills even further in the community, plus I could learn from the very best from all over the world. I took the initiative to join some Discord channels for open source communities and try to contribute to an open source which then somewhat went begrudgingly bad. Frankly, the experience wasn’t as good as I expected. Trying to pinch my way in a Google Summer of Code project, I am overwhelmed by numerous people trying to do the same.\n</p>\n  <p>\nI thought open source would be like this all the time and it failed me. But then, I took my second chance and joined Layer5. First two weeks, I tried to familiarize myself with the project and joined in the community calls. I remember sharing my screen the first time in the community call, and it was thrilling, my hands can't stop shaking. I was very excited to share my tiny bit of change in the UI which then welcomed wholeheartedly by the people inside. Overall, I met with a lot of wonderful people that don't mind extending their hands if I am in difficulty. My thoughts on open source were wrong and I realize that it's just a little badness from the overall goodness. Just like Yin Yang. Layer5 has been a supportive community that not only develops your technical side, it nurtures your thinking and reasoning.\n  </p>\n  \n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"invert\" to=\"/community/members/rudraksh-pareek\">\n    Rudraksh Pareek\n    </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Rudraksh } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"rudraksh-pareek\" />\n  <br/>\n  <p>\nMy journey with open source started when I got into college and fell into the company of some geeky open source evangelists. They were the folks from my local open source communities, OSDC and JODC. I learnt there what it means to be a good open source citizen. The fact that I could learn by contributing to a real world project albeit being a student, novice in programming, intrigued me the most and thus I had this goal clear in my mind to make an impact by working on open source software.\nHowever, it was easier said than done. I started making small contributions to some projects that I came across but couldn't do much past that. Me being a shy kid and the lack of a welcoming community always came into my way. But this all changed when I approached Lee in the CNCF slack for a GSoC internship. I was invited to Layer5. Since day one, I could feel there was something much different about how the community is treated here. Just as I joined, I received a ton of welcome messages and resources to get started. With the course of time and some great advice I moved on from that internship. I decided to become a good contributor first. Though I started with small contributions here too, this time I was able to scale up with time with help and guidance from the community. Whenever I was assigned something, I tried to get my teeth into it as deep as I could before reaching out for help. This helped me learn a lot in a healthy way.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    There was so much happening around and I wanted to be a part of it all. So I started attending all the meetings and was able to put my finger into many pies. I soon became better at expressing my thoughts and pretty soon, I developed an interest in CI/CD practices. Starting with small workflows, I went on to write GitHub actions for performing SMI conformance and SMP tests in CI pipelines. At the same time, I also found myself working on mesheryctl and the adapters as I came across bugs while working on the actions. Fast forward a few months and I was nominated a Meshery CI maintainer. I couldn't be much happier than this but little did I know there was more coming.\nI learnt about how internships worked at Layer5 during the time I spent and agreed with it in the best sense. Generally, open source projects tend to get more welcoming and open around the months of internship program applications. However, this short span often leads to unjust outcomes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Thus, I believe paying back for what you give to the project is a philosophy in the best faith of everyone in the long term. I kept my patience until I was asked to apply for an internship and I eventually got selected. I finally knew that I had started to make that impact I always wanted to.\nDuring the course of my internship, I'll be working under the mentorship of Utkarsh Srivastava on improving Meshery cloud, the remote provider, and making it securely distributable and usable in \"on premise environments\". I'll also be collaborating with Ashish Tiwari on integrating a workflow engine with Meshery introducing best practices to be followed by management software.\nLooking forward to learning and growing during this time while continuing to try my best to help others in the community.\n\n  </p>\n<p>\nThank you.\n</p>\n\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"invert\" to=\"/community/members/nithish-karthik\"> Nithish Karthik </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Nithish } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"nithish-karthik\" />\n  <br />\n  <p>\n   I knew exactly what I wanted to do ever since my childhood, I wanted to become a programmer. Technology related stuff always intrigued me. But I had to prepare for an entrance examination IITJEE which required enormous dedication and focus to succeed. And so, I had to put my coding dreams on hold till I joined college.\n</p>\n<p>\n\nBut after I joined college, I felt a sense of freedom within me, in the sense that I could now pursue my passion wholeheartedly. So, the next question was, \"Where do I start ?\".\nThere were a lot of buzz words going around in my college among my peers like CP, Dev, AI and ML etc. I also noticed that people were forcing themselves to do them even when they had no sense of passion or appreciation towards the field. But for me, I always had more joy in the process of doing something than the outcome I get from it. So, I started exploring various fields to find what I loved the most. And I found that I wanted to do development.\n\n  </p>\n  <p>\nSo, I started working on myself. After I got the fundamentals clear, I wanted to have some practical experience to have an idea of how production grade products are being made. So, I worked on a couple of startups to get an exposure to real world development. And I learned a lot during that period. But then, I felt I needed to switch my gear. The idea of open source has always intrigued me the most but my efforts towards open source contribution has not been a success because,\n\n1. I always got intimidated by the size of codebase\n2. I didn't have people guiding me\n\nSome of my seniors, who had the best interest in me, encouraged me to get into open source, but I did not take it seriously because I felt intimidated by the idea. I instead thought I would look for some open source internships that way I would have someone mentoring me and that would help me in starting my open source journey. I went through many programs but most of them were closed at that time, except, Meshery in LFX. I thought, this is the only choice I have, let's do it, I had nothing to lose. I applied for that program and as a prerequisite, I had to engage with the community. I looked at the community calendar and I saw that there was a newcomer's call that day and I attended it. I have never had such a warm welcome in any other communities.\n\n{\" \"}\n\n</p>\n<p>\nOn that day, I knew that this community is special and I should spend more time with it. I explored the projects and as usual, I felt intimidated, but this time, I had people, wonderful people to help me. I landed my first open source PR, which was a single line style change. But the encouragement and support I got from the community for that was so wonderful . I realised that this community is not just about building best quality products but also about building best quality human beings. It has been a roller coaster ride with Layer5 since then. I got so involved with the process that I had stopped caring about getting that internship.\n\n  </p>\n  <p>\n The community has really wonderful people who taught me not only about coding, but also about \"How to be\". I am really grateful that I found this community and I hope that everyone has a chance to experience this. \nI started engaging more in the community projects, especially Meshery UI and always kept coming up with ways to improve it. \n  </p>\n  <p>\n  And fast forward to September 2021, I was told to enroll for the LFX fall term mentorship program and here I am. But, this has never been the goal for me, there is more to me and Layer5 than this internship. I will be engaged with this community as long as I can and will try to give back as much as I can.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n  Thank you\n  </p>\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"invert\" to=\"/community/members/ashish-tiwari\"> Ashish Tiwari </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Ashish } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"ashish-tiwari\" />\n  <br />\n  <p>\nI started my programming career in 2020 when my classmates were bagging internships.I started late because the first two years of my college I never thought that I was a \"programming guy\" as I always was more of a Physics/Mathematics guy. But in 2020, when the pandemic hit I started programming from \"hello world\". I thought I was too late to the party and often felt overwhelmed. After 1 year of getting a taste of everything from data structures, web development, databases and everything in between that a CS undergraduate comes across; I thought to call myself a Backend dev. But I still was dissatisfied and finding something interesting when I came across the concept of containerization which looked magic to me. From there it was a roller coaster ride to kubernetes and then understanding service meshes. I immediately was drawn into the entire CNCF ecosystem.\n  </p>\n  <p>\nAfter procrastinating for a while, I learnt golang one night, made a side project to feel confident in it and dove back into watching CNCF talks explaining some exciting technology in Golang code.During all this my friend and also my current mentor, Utkarsh helped me through and through. He explained to me what Meshery is and I was immediately drawn in because Meshery is a good vantage point to the entire CNCF ecosystem. Believe me, while working on meshery at one point or another you will run into almost all major projects under CNCF. \nLike for any other beginner, it was all too overwhelming but exciting at the same time. Man it's such a rush when you realize that you don't know so much stuff because then there is an open window for absorbing all that stuff. I started going through docs, blogs and CNCF talks(shit that rhymed). I still binge CNCF talks. There is a plethora of good talks for you, if you are a beginner. I always prefer those over any \"youtube tutorials\". Anyways, back to my journey. \n  </p>\n  <p>\nSo two months ago, I found an open issue in mesheryctl. I solved the issue/enhancement, showed the code in a community meeting and got the PR merged. This was my first ever open source contribution. From there it just took off. I wrote a new command in mesheryctl then wrote unit tests. All this while trying to get an opportunity to write code for any core component like meshery server or adapters. Then one day I accidentally got into a WASM filter meeting(believe me,joined accidentally), got asked to add one feature and I said - \"yes\". And this is how it starts for most people. You get out of your comfort zone and say \"yes\", start learning new stuff, make mistakes, get corrected and the cycle continues. Fast forward two months, I was offered an internship.From what I have learnt as a person who started late is that you only need two things- \"Curiosity\" to ask questions out of your comfort zone and \"Resilience\" to absorb answers when they are thrown at you. Layer5 is an amazing community. \n  </p>\n  <p>\nI guarantee you will not find such a warm and welcoming community so easily. If you come here for internships, you won't be here for long (or anywhere else to be honest). When your goals are solely to gain knowledge, experience while contributing to a niche, new and exciting tech- the opportunities will be waiting for you. I still have a long way to go and so much to learn. My journey with this project is certainly going to be longer than the span of this internship. \n  </p>\n  \\- Nithish, Ashish, Rudraksh and Bariq\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Meet the Fall Interns of 2021","date":"Sep 1st, 2021","author":"Interns of Fall 2021","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmQAAABXRUJQVlA4IFgAAACQAwCdASoUAAgAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAWx1qS/N/KEcAAP708SrA630cJNZXsz4L+N3T79yuFdeUg5KuxK8pYWeNy+enu9bFz9QGImWZcnYa38AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/67f85/fall-interns.webp","srcSet":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/ba84b/fall-interns.webp 750w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/3780a/fall-interns.webp 1080w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/bed15/fall-interns.webp 1366w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/67f85/fall-interns.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.39479166666666665}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/fall-interns.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmQAAABXRUJQVlA4IFgAAACQAwCdASoUAAgAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAWx1qS/N/KEcAAP708SrA630cJNZXsz4L+N3T79yuFdeUg5KuxK8pYWeNy+enu9bFz9QGImWZcnYa38AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/67f85/fall-interns.webp","srcSet":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/ba84b/fall-interns.webp 750w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/3780a/fall-interns.webp 1080w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/bed15/fall-interns.webp 1366w,\n/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/67f85/fall-interns.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.39479166666666665}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/dafe7118c78029c11e54090632bfe719/fall-interns.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/meet-the-fall-interns-of-2021"}},{"id":"41e991fb-eaeb-55d4-be96-3a0e20e3329f","body":"\n\n\nimport gsocLogo from \"./gsoc.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n<img src={gsocLogo} className=\"gsoc-image\" align=\"right\" alt=\"gsoc-image\" />\n<p>\n  Hi, I am Piyush Singariya, a short description of me would be “another\n  software engineer watching anime”, in the longer version I am a 2021 graduate\n  from IIT Roorkee, who loves to watch anime and play video games all day.

During this boot camp, participants work with an open source organisation on a project for 4 weeks with the help of organisation mentors and get rewarded at the end of the boot camp upon successful project completion.\n  </p>\n\n  During the boot camp, Layer5 received a total of 8 mentees - all from Nigeria. These mentees were teamed up to work on the 3 project ideas selected by Layer5. Each project had an average of 2 members of the community who were delegated as mentors to oversee the contributions of the mentees.

It was in the middle of the pandemic, though, with my mind trying to find an escape, that I stumbled upon Layer5. Within the first week of joining the Layer5 community, I had a pull request posted, and much to my surprise, found myself demo'ing it in the very next community meeting. In retrospect, it was a minor pull request, making some UI changes for Meshery. The encouragement I received was so welcoming and supportive. After that first week's experience, and so much technology and projects to explore, I was hooked - there was no turning back for me from that point.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    I started learning more about the projects in Layer5 and its tech stack. From how Meshery Server was using gRPC and protobufs to communicate with each of its service mesh adaptors to defining how <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">SMI Conformance</Link> works and the <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"https://layer5.io/projects/service-mesh-performance\">Service Mesh Performance</Link> specification to how Meshery UI leverages some awesome libraries like NextJS, BillboardJS, and Redux. It has been through contributing to  each of these areas, that I have learned each of these technologies more deeply and it was all possible because of the continuous influx of awesome support from the community, especially <Link to=\"/community/members/abishek-kumar\">Abishek Kumar</Link> <i>and I probably won't stop poking him for support anytime soon</i>.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    As I look forward to a structured internship with Layer5 through Google Summer of Code this summer, I do so knowing I will be collaborating with the large Layer5 community, engineers from other technology companies and spending a lot of time with Soham and Piyush. For my part, I'll be working on a visual topology to help service mesh operators map their deployments, model their application performance, and parse their service proxy logs. I am ready to make an impact, learn more, and help other community members ( and watch as they, too, are initiated into the Layer5 community through ritual of giving an awkward first-timer introduction in our Community Meeting 😛).\n  </p>\n  \n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/piyush-singariya\">\n    Piyush Singariya\n    </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Piyush } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"piyush-singariya\" />\n  <p>\n    It all started with an idea, the idea of doing open source contributions. And with that after scrolling through many open source communities, I found Layer5, jumped up into our Slack workspace, started learning about Meshery. I raised a PR and was immediately made to feel like a rockstar. I began  meeting more of the community members, learning more about Meshery and its command line client, `mesheryctl` with each contribution. And you know, its extrenely gratifying to have your pull request merged, and that feeling is amplified by the feedback and attention you receive as a contributor at Layer5.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    I knew that I wanted to engage even more deeply and learn all that I can from the seasoned engineers at Layer5. And so, I applied for internship. Layer5 takes internships seriously and doesn't accept anyone into internship until you have proven your commitment to their awesome projects.\n    And at the time of writing this, it’s been almost three months of contributing bfore being accepted as GSoC student. I have spent most of my time focusing on Layer5’s Meshery project and it’s command line client, `mesheryctl`.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    And so, we reach the beginning of my GSoC 2021 program, which began on the night of May 17th, 2021 when I learned that I had been selected as a GSoC Participant with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). I am hyped up and excited to go ahead with Layer5 for the upcoming months.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    My GSoC project is about introducing interesting and important features to Meshery Server and `mesheryctl`. Such as automating Documentation and Interactive playground for Meshery Server’s REST API endpoints, adding commands related to performance testing and enhancing Meshery’s environment health checking, introducing unit testing for `mesheryctl`, and CI/CD and documentation for all the new features.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    It has been 2 weeks since I have started my GSoC’21 tenure with the Layer5 community, and from the very beginning (I mean before GSoC), I have learned a lot with my code contributions and the Community here. I began with setting up the performance command under mesheryctl and Open API Specification 2.0 for REST API documentation to the project. I am learning a lot of new things, like Unit Testing, Open API Specification, and much more to include.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/soham-sonawane\"> Soham Sonawane </Link>\n  </h2>\n  <img src={ Soham } className=\"image-right-no-shadow\" alt=\"soham-sonaware\" />\n  <p>\n    I got to know about Layer5 last year in December when one of my batchmates told me that he was contributing to the community. He asked me if I wanted to join Slack and wanted to contribute to a project. So I looked at the projects on Github and some open issues that I could contribute to. Me being a frontend developer I saw an issue related to removing whitespaces and minor frontend changes. I just made a PR and it was merged then I joined the Slack workspace and attended the <Link to=\"/community/newcomers\">Newcomers</Link> meeting. I was introduced to a lot of things that I could work on. All of them felt amazing and interesting, all I had to do was “signal” and I could work on any one of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n    At first I thought that I should just work on layer5.io or maybe NightHawk, but then I was given an opportunity to work on something that I had never done before. It has been around 4 months that I have been a part of the community and I am actively trying to add to the project attending weekly meetings where everyone shares amazing stuff about what they did.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    As I said earlier my project is something that I had never worked on before, very interesting to work on, it adds one of the most important and unique features to Meshery. Meshery's MeshMap enables users to visualize their service meshes, look at important statistics. It also enables users to design their own service meshes by either importing their designs from a yaml file or by dragging and dropping service mesh components into a\n    canvas, creating edges, grouping components, persisting these designs to see or edit later, realizing these designs by actually deploying them as service meshes and a lot more.\n</p>\n<p>\n    My job is to be the God of CytoscapeJS, who knows every nook and cranny of the library that enables us to create the visual topology. It's been a week since I have started my LFX internship and I have been working on visual topology even before that. These months of contributing code have taught me a lot. The first task that was given to me was to explore the\n    CytoscapeJS library and demonstrate a proof of concept of animated edges between 2 components. I sat for 3 hours straight right after the community meeting creating the demo and posted a video on our slack. I was never\n    appreciated better than on that day.

Extension points allow you to  augment the behavior of Meshery by either adding entirely new capabilities or affecting the behavior of existing functionality, as see in the figure below.\n\n<div className=\"img-center\">\n  <a href={MesheryExtensibility} style={{backgroundColor: \"rgba(255,255,255,0)\"}}><img src={MesheryExtensibility} /></a>\n</div>\n\nAs you can see in the diagram, Meshery offers many types of extension points.\n\n- <strong>Extensible Service Mesh Adapters</strong> - bring your own service mesh.\n- <strong>Extensible APIs</strong> - bring your own GraphQL resolvers and expose new, custom endpoints.\n- <strong>Extensible Load Generators</strong> - Meshery supports three types of load generators, however, you can bring your own and plug it in.\n- <strong>Extensible Providers</strong> - the v0.5.0 release delivers dynamic injection of Remote Provider extensions. Providers are a powerful mechanism for integrating Meshery into your existing tooling and systems.\n\nThere are two types of Providers in Meshery: Local - built into Meshery and Remote - implemented by anyone or any organization that wishes to integrate with Meshery. Remote Provider extensibility includes:\n\n  * Pluggable UI functionality\n  * Pluggable Backend functionality\n  * Pluggable Authentication and Authorization\n  * Long-Term Persistence\n  * Enhanced Visualization\n  * Historical Reporting  \n\nLearn more about the platform Meshery provides to extend its funcionality by exploring its <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility\">extension points</Link>. If you have or are building your own <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility/providers\">Remote Provider</Link>, let us know!\n<h2>MeshKit and Meshery Adapter Library</h2>\n\nAs a service mesh toolkit, MeshKit aims to specifically focus on service mesh management and provides broadly useful functionality, it provides a standard policy for error handling and logging across all Meshery components, and implementations for error handling, logging, and tracing.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>MeshKit provides common data models of Service Mesh Interface conformance testing for Meshery.</li>\n  <li>The low-level API abstract by MeshKit to the high-level functions provides out-of-the-box functions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Meshery Adapter Library</h3>\n\n<p>The Meshery Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of functionality for managing the lifecycle of service meshes and their workloads.</p>\n<div className=\"img-center\">\n  <a href={MesheryAdapterLibrary}><img src={MesheryAdapterLibrary} /></a>\n</div>\n\n* The library provides a set of interfaces, some with default implementations like a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh-specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.\n* The default configuration provider we use Viper to reads the adapter specific configuration, and the configuration providers are implementations of an interface, this can be flexible if anyone wants to implement it on their own.\n\n<div className=\"intro\" style={{textAlign: \"center\", margin: \"2rem 4rem\"}}><p>Read <Link to=\"/community/members/michael-gfeller\">Maintainer Michael Gfeller</Link>'s blog post <Link to=\"/blog/meshery/introducing-meshkit-and-the-meshery-adapter-library\">Introduction MeshKit and the Meshery Adapter Library</Link> for more details.</p></div>\n\nWith the increasing the number and diversity of service meshes supported by Meshery, you might find the list of [Supported Service Meshes](https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes) a helpful, complete list.\n\n<h2>Meshery Operator</h2>\n<img style={{float: \"left\", maxWidth: \"300px\", width: \"20%\", padding: \"1.25rem\"}} src={MesheryOperator} />\n<p style={{display: \"block\", width: \"100%\"}}>\nAs a Kubernetes custom controller, Meshery Operator provides a Kubernetes-native approach to interfacing with Meshery. Kubernetes is where service meshes have gotten their initial foothold, and therefore, important that Meshery interface to Kubernetes natively.\n</p>\n<p>Some service meshes support non-containerized workloads outside of the cluster and will grow in this focus over time. While Meshery Operator is Kubernetes only in the v0.5.0 release, Meshery's arichitecture makes considerations for different workload and platform types.</p>\n\n<div style={{display: \"flex\", width: \"100%\"}}>\n  <div style={{textAlign: \"center\", flex: \"50%\"}}>\n    <a href={MesheryOperatorShot} style={{backgroundColor: \"rgba(255,255,255,0)\"}}><img style={{width: \"100%\"}} src={MesheryOperatorShot} /></a>\n  </div>\n  <ul style={{flex: \"50%\"}}>\n    <li>Meshery Operator is the multi-service mesh operator that runs as a Kubernetes Operator and defines two custom resources: MeshSync and Meshery Broker (NATS)</li>\n    <li>Meshery Operator is provides abilities includes cluster discovery, service mesh discovery, and data streaming via NATS.</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n\n<h3>MeshSync</h3>\n<p>MeshSync is available as a Kubernetes custom resource that provides tiered discovery and continual synchronization with Meshery Server as to the state of the Kubernetes cluster, service meshes, and their workloads.</p>\n\n<div style={{display: \"flex\"}}>\n<img style={{maxWidth: \"300px\", width: \"20%\", padding: \"1.25rem\"}} src={MeshSync} />\n<ul>\n\n  <li>MeshSync is one of a family of custom controllers within Meshery Operator and is the <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/meshsync\">heartbeat of Meshery</Link>, pumping information about service meshes and their workloads throughout Meshery's components.</li>\n  <li>MeshSync helps Meshery mesh with meshes by helping define a service mesh agnostic object model.</li>\n  <li>It provides ability to detect service meshes and services deployed on the cluster, and snapshot stored in-memory and refreshed periodically; \nmaintain the local snapshot of the cluster and refreshed periodically.</li>\n  <li>MeshSync These abilities above help Meshery operations more resilient.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n<h4>Relational Database</h4>\n\nMeshery's <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture/database\">relational database</a> serves as a repository for MeshSync data, user preferences, and system settings. This database should be considered ephemeral and given that it operates as a cache. Meshery relational database offers federated datasets for managing multiple Kubernetes cluster and multiple service meshes.\n\n<div className=\"img-center\">\n  <a href={MesheryDB}><img src={MesheryDB} /></a>\n</div>\n\n<p>Learn more and consider <a href=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshsync\">contributing</a> to MeshSync.</p>\n\n## GraphQL Support\n\nMeshery now supports <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/concepts/architecture#meshery-operator-and-meshsync\">GraphQL instances</a> between Meshery UI and Meshery Server offering any GraphQL client the  power to ask for exactly what they need from mesh. This new API sets the stage preparing for  exciting features in upcoming releases. Extension points are also built into Meshery's GraphQL support allowing integrators to bring their own GraphQL resolvers to the Meshery server runtime.\n\n\n<h2>Meshery Command Line Interface Enhancements</h2>\nThe beloved `mesheryctl` introduces new commands in the v0.5.0 release expands the CLI's support of multiple Meshery deployments with the `context` command and control over when Meshery auto-updates with the `channel` command.\n\n<h3>Managing Multiple Meshery Deployments</h3>\nIntroduced in this release is the meshconfig - a configuration file that describes Meshery deployments in separate <i>contexts</i>. A Meshery <i>context</i> describes deployments across Docker hosts and Kubernetes clusters. <code>mesheryctl system context</code> enables user to easy manage multiple deployments of Meshery by quickly switching contexts. \n\n### Subscribing to Meshery Release Channels\n`mesheryctl system channel` allows you to easily set and switch between which Meshery release channel (stable or edge) that you want a particilar Meshery deployment (`context`) to use. Meshery deployments subscribe to one of two release channels and can either automatically self-update the deployment or prompt you to update the deployment. Alternatively, you can pin a given Meshery deployment to a specific release should you want tighter control over when Meshery updates. Read more about <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/project/build-and-release#release-channels\">Meshery's <i>stable</i> and <i>edge</i> release channels</Link>. \n\n\nReview the <Link to=\"https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl\">mesheryctl Command Reference</Link> for details on all subcommands, flags, and their behavior.\n\n<h2>On to v0.6.0</h2>\n\nTo get a more comprehensive list of the bug fixes and enhancements packaged in the v0.5.0 release, see the [Meshery Documentation](https://docs.meshery.io/).

Many people inside and outside of the\n    Layer5 Community have seen the effects of your contributions but may not\n    know the backstory as to who Jash is and how you arrived at your maintainer\n    role. Indulge us. How did you come across the Layer5 community? What made\n    you stay?\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Jash:</span>\n  <p>\n    Back in August 2020, I was looking for an open-source organization. I found\n    my friend\n    <Link to=\"/community/members/tanuj-agarwal\"> Tanuj </Link> was part of Layer5,\n    and I thought of joining it. I jumped onto my first community call, and Whoo!\n    It was so smooth. I was delighted to see the overwhelming response of the community.\n    I loved the way the community encouraged every newcomer to their first contribution.\n    After that, I never looked back. I still remember my first community meeting\n    in which I introduced myself, highlighting my interests in React. The response\n    was <Link to=\"/community/members/lee-calcote\"> Lee </Link> giving an overly positive reaction.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Ruth:</span>\n  <p>\n    I can totally relate to how amazing the Layer5 onboarding process is unique!\n    Layer5 Projects has many active, open-source projects. You’ve been\n    consistently contributing to a few of them. Which one(s) are you currently\n    focusing on? Psst. Also, which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Jash:</span>\n  <p>\n    I started contributing to docs and soon dived into Layer5 websites. While I\n    have worked on almost all websites, t (a little in some). The next\n    generation Layer5 website (built on Gatsby) was the site I worked on the\n    longest. We recently launched this new site (it takes a lot to launch a\n    website). Currently, I am working on enhancements to the website and on\n    Layer5’s upcoming discussion forum. I think, after this, you would already\n    know my favorite one.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Ruth:</span>\n  <p>\n    Definitely, winks! Have you worked with any other open source project? How\n    does Layer5 compare?\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Jash:</span>\n  <p>\n    I am a part of my college’s open-source organization. I have contributed to\n    and also have mentored a few open-source projects there. Open source is\n    always fun - it doesn't matter where you do it. The difference I found here\n    was the vast and diverse community that was missing there. Also, exposure to\n    different technologies was advantageous for me.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span>Ruth:</span>\n  <p>\n    You know for me, coming to The Next Generation Layer5 Website was done in\n    the space of 6 months which is really impressive. How was the team able to\n    pull that off?\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span>Jash:</span>\n  <p>\n    It was a pretty big task. Many people have worked on it(At the time of\n    launch we had 140 contributors). It started with Tanuj and me, and then got\n    many hands to help us and strive towards its completion. I can’t write all\n    those names, or else it would take an entire page to note them down. And\n    this is what communities are meant for; open source is intended for. It was\n    a combined effort, and we worked on almost everything. The team worked on\n    Gatsby, GraphQL, SEO, Analytics, and anything related to the website. The\n    two mentors <Link to=\"/community/members/lee-calcote\"> Lee </Link> and\n    <Link to=\"/community/members/nikhil-ladha\"> Nikhil </Link>,\n    were quite helpful for the team to bring it through 6 months.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span> Ruth:</span>\n  <p>\n    It’s amazing you are in school and still actively contribute to Layer5, how\n    are you able to multitask it?\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span> Jash:</span>\n  <p>\n    I once mentioned that while my exams were going on, I would study the entire\n    day, and when I took breaks, I would just open up Github and work on some\n    minor issues. If you are interested in it, you will find a way, I would say.\n    This is what helped me. One of the advantages of being in such a diverse\n    environment is that when you are stuck somewhere, the work doesn't stop,\n    some other contributor picks it up, and it goes on.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span> Ruth:</span>\n  <p>\n    I’m really curious, what does being a Layer5 maintainer mean to you? How has\n    being a maintainer impacted you?\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span> Jash:</span>\n  <p>\n    I still remember my first pull request being reviewed. And now I am on the\n    other side, reviewing requests. Being a maintainer was a rollercoaster of an\n    experience to me. You don’t just review PRs and point out changes, but you\n    also have to think of fixes for them. The evolution of green to purple is\n    the joy every open-source contributor wishes to see. And me being the one\n    doing it makes me feel good. Being a maintainer adds responsibility on the\n    one hand and gives freedom on the other hand.\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n  <span> Ruth:</span>\n  <p>\n    I really picked a lot of points on that! Do you have any advice for\n    individuals hoping to become Layer5 contributors or potentially maintainers?\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n  <span> Jash:</span>\n  <p>\n    My advice would be to not look for becoming something. I never thought of\n    becoming a maintainer. You just enjoy whatever you are doing, and when the\n    time comes, you will get it.

MeshKit can be considered a derivative of `go-kit` with specific focus on service mesh management.\n\nIn the Meshery v0.5.0 release, MeshKit has been enhanced and expanded substantially. Considering that the MeshKit library provides broadly useful functionality, it is used in a growing number of Meshery components. It is intended to be one of the top level libraries in the Meshery ecosystem. <div className=\"fact\">Meshkit provides functionality useful across all Meshery components.</div>\n\nMeshKit is a toolkit for Layer5’s microservices, and is positioned to become Layer5’s middleware component for Layer5’s microservices, leveraging other libraries like `go-kit/kit`. In complement to functionality provided by a service mesh, its purpose is to provide implementations for common cross-cutting concerns like error handling, logging, and tracing. Uniform error handling and logging across all Meshery components helps to implement efficient tooling for observability, monitoring and troubleshooting. The library provides some common data models for Meshery, notably for <Link to=\"/smi\">Service Mesh Interface conformance testing</Link>, and Kubernetes' `kubeconfig`.\n\nAnother central component in Meshkit is the `utils` package.\n\nThis package provides a Kubernetes and a Helm client that implements functionality based on the Go libraries of these tools. The API exposed by these libraries is quite low-level, and the higher-level functions of the `utils` package simplifies usage of Kubernetes and Helm clients significantly.\nAnother advantage MeshKit that it is not necessary to use the command line versions of these tools, providing a more tailored experience for developers,\nand better logging and error handling integration.\n\n<Link to=\"https://github.com/layer5io/meshkit\">MeshKit</Link> is simple and straight\nforward to use, as the following code example illustrates.{\" \"}\n\n```go\npackage main\n\nimport (\n\t\"os\"\n\n\tmeshkitlogger \"github.com/layer5io/meshkit/logger\"\n\tmeshkitkubernetes \"github.com/layer5io/meshkit/utils/kubernetes\"\n\t\"k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n\t// nginx contains the deployment manifest for nginx.\n\tnginx := `apiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx-deployment\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: nginx\n  replicas: 2 # tells deployment to run 2 pods matching the template\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n      - name: nginx\n        image: nginx:1.14.2\n        ports:\n        - containerPort: 80\n`\n\n\t// Create an instance of the meshkit logger handler.\n\tlog, err := meshkitlogger.New(\"ExampleApp\",\n\t\tmeshkitlogger.Options{Format: meshkitlogger.JsonLogFormat, DebugLevel: false})\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\tlog.Info(\"successfully instantiated meshkit logger\")\n\n\t// Detect kubeconfig on the local system.\n\tconfig, err := meshkitkubernetes.DetectKubeConfig()\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\tlog.Info(config.Host)\n\n\t// Create Kubernetes client set for the detected kubeconfig using the Kubernetes Go client library.\n\tclientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\t// Create an instance of the meshkit Kubernetes client ...\n\tclient, err := meshkitkubernetes.New(clientset, *config)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\n\t// ... and use it to deploy nginx to the cluster.\n\terr2 := client.ApplyManifest([]byte(nginx), meshkitkubernetes.ApplyOptions{\n\t\tNamespace: \"default\",\n\t\tUpdate:    true,\n\t\tDelete:    false,\n\t})\n\tif err2 != nil {\n\t\tlog.Error(err2)\n\t\tos.Exit(1)\n\t}\n\tlog.Info(\"successfully applied the manifest\")\n}\n```\n\n## Meshery Adapters\n\nMeshery adapters are management plane components and manage the lifecycle of service meshes. This includes installation and deletion, configuration, and verification that an installation follows recommended practices. In addition, Meshery adapters can assess to what extent a service mesh complies to the <Link to=\"/blog/announcements/a-standard-interface-for-service-meshes\">Service Mesh Interface standard</Link>. Meshery adapters support management of multiple versions of their respective service mesh and also come bundled with sample applications that can be deployed for easy and quick exploration of service mesh capabilities. <div className=\"fact\">Meshery adapters manage the lifecycle of service meshes.</div>\n\nA Meshery adapter is a gRPC server that exposes the `MeshServiceServer` interface:\n\n```go\n// MeshServiceServer is the server API for MeshService service.\ntype MeshServiceServer interface {\n\tCreateMeshInstance(context.Context, *CreateMeshInstanceRequest) (*CreateMeshInstanceResponse, error)\n\tMeshName(context.Context, *MeshNameRequest) (*MeshNameResponse, error)\n\tApplyOperation(context.Context, *ApplyRuleRequest) (*ApplyRuleResponse, error)\n\tSupportedOperations(context.Context, *SupportedOperationsRequest) (*SupportedOperationsResponse, error)\n\tStreamEvents(*EventsRequest, MeshService_StreamEventsServer) error\n}\n```\n\n- `CreateMeshInstance` sets up the Kubernetes client. It does not, as the name might imply, create an instance of a service mesh.\n- `MeshName` returns the name of the mesh, configured in the adapter.\n- `SupportedOperations` returns all supported operations, configured in the adapter. An operation is e.g. the installation of a service mesh.\n- `ApplyOperation` executes the operation specified in the request. It is one of the supported operations.\n- `StreamEvents` allows sending events from the server to the client.\n\nThis API is one of the extension points of Meshery, making it easy to add support for new service meshes to Meshery. Meshery adapters abstract away differences in installation and configuration of the various service meshes.<div className=\"fact\">Adapters allow Meshery to interface with the different service meshes, exposing their differentiated value to users.</div>\n\nIn general, the various service mesh implementations are installed and configured in their own way. For instance, some service meshes have their own installer, like `istioctl` for Istio, while others use Helm charts, like Consul. One of the purposes of Meshery adapters is to abstract these differences away.\n\n## Meshery Adapter Library\n\nAs can be expected, adapters for the various meshes have a lot of code in common. Initially, this common code was copied from one adapter implementation to the next. The question arose whether common code should be factored out to one or several libraries. After some discussion, the community decided to move some of the more general code to Meshkit, and adapter specific code to a new library.\n\nThus, the Meshery Adapter Library was born.\n\nIt reduces the amount of boilerplate code in the adapters substantially, making adapter code easier to follow. This is especially valuable in an open source community where typically many developers contribute, for varying amounts of time. For the same reasons, it is important such libraries are easily understandable.\n\nAlso, it means new adapters can be implemented quickly, as only configuration and operations that differ between services meshes need to be implemented.\n\n<div className=\"fact\">\n  The Meshery Adapter Library provides a common and consistent set of\n  functionality that Meshery adapters use for managing the lifecycle of\n  service meshes and their workloads.\n</div>\n\nThe initial commit was submitted on October 6th, 2020 based on a refactoring effort in the adapter for the Kuma service mesh. Within a few months, several adapters have been refactored or implemented from scratch based on the Meshery Adapter Library.\n\nThe main purpose of the Meshery Adapter Library is to:\n\n- provide a set of interfaces, some with default implementations, to be used and extended by adapters.\n- implement cross-cutting concerns like logging, error handling, and tracing.\n- provide a mini framework implementing the gRPC server that allows plugging in the mesh specific configuration and operations implemented in the adapters.\n\nThe core interface in the library is the adapter `Handler` interface:\n\n```go\n// Interface Handler is extended by adapters, and used in package api/grpc that implements the MeshServiceServer.\ntype Handler interface {\n\t// GetName returns the name of the adapter.\n\tGetName() string\n\t// CreateInstance instantiates clients used in deploying and managing mesh instances, e.g. Kubernetes clients.\n\tCreateInstance([]byte, string, *chan interface{}) error\n\t// ApplyOperation applies an adapter operation. This is adapter specific and needs to be implemented by each adapter.\n\tApplyOperation(context.Context, OperationRequest) error\n\t// ListOperations list all operations an adapter supports.\n\tListOperations() (Operations, error)\n\n\t// Need not implement this method and can be reused\n\tStreamErr(*Event, error) // Streams an error event, e.g. to a channel\n\tStreamInfo(*Event)       // Streams an informational event, e.g. to a channel\n}\n```\n\nIt corresponds closely to the gRPC API discussed above, and indeed these methods are called in the implementation of the `MeshServiceServer` interface. This implementation is also part of the Meshery Adapter Library.\n\nUsing `struct` embedding, an adapter extends the default implementation `Adapter` of the interface `Handler` from the library.\nUsually, it is sufficient that this adapter handler overrides only the `ApplyOperation` function from the default implementation.\n(There, it is a no-op implementation.)\n\nThe figure below illustrates this and the usage of the library in an adapter.\n\n<img\n  src={mesheryAdapterLibrary}\n  className=\"image-center\"\n  alt=\"meshery adapter library\"\n/>\n\nIn the `main` package of the adapter, the default configuration provider `Viper` from the library is instantiated, and reads the adapter specific configuration. This includes a specification of all available operations. As configuration providers are implementations of an interface, you can choose any of the providers from the library, or implement your own.\n\nNext, an instance of the adapter handler is created. Other components, for instance a logger, may be created depending on needs and requirements, which is symbolize by the three dots in the figure.\n\nThe `service` is a struct that holds all the parameters that specify an adapter service, like the port the gRPC server is running on, and the instance of the adapter handler created in a previous step. This struct is passed to the `Start` function from the library. This `Start` function wraps the gRPC server, wiring up all necessary components, and starts the service. The developer does not need to touch any gRPC code.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nExtracting common code from adapters to the two new libraries has proven to be a worthwhile investment. It led to cleaner code as well as cleaner application architecture, shortened implementation time for new adapters considerably, and upleveled the quality of Meshery's adapters through consistency of implementation.\n\n\n<div className=\"intro\"><p>P.S.

Michael is an avid research enthusiast in addition to holding the title of Chief Engineer at his day job. With exhaustive interests ranging from software architecture to systems security, he has been working with cloud architecture for the past four years.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Shriti:</span>\n<p>\nMichael, thank you for joining me today. Many people inside and outside of the Layer5 Community have seen the affects of your contributions, but may not know the backstory as to who Michael is and how you arrived at your maintainer role. Indulge us. How did you come across the Layer5 community? What made you stay?\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Michael:</span>\n<p>\n\"Hey Shriti, thank you for having me. If I remember correctly, I was looking for a professional focus area earlier this year, and landed on service meshes. I had worked with service meshes before, which piqued my initial interest. I had worked with Istio as part of my work for some time, and in the same context I stumbled across Meshery. I wasn’t able to dig deep in Meshery back then, but the concept sounded fascinating to me. Additionally, I had been benefiting from open source, both personally and professionally for a long time, but apart from a few minor contributions, I had never been able to give back to the community. I hoped to correct that.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I re-discovered Meshery and the Layer5 community, listened to a recording of a community meeting, and read a couple of blog posts describing the community and member experience posts. One that stood out for me was a post by <Link to=\"/community/members/nikhil-ladha\">MeshMate Nikhil Ladha</Link>. Going by his words, it appeared to be a warm, diverse and active community. My suspicions were confirmed when I joined. Layer5 offers a wholesome, interactive community in addition to unbiasedly providing help and guidance around the virtual corner.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Shriti:</span>\n<p>\n<Link to=\"/projects\">Layer5 projects</Link> has a number of active, open source projects. You’ve been consistently contributing to a few of them. Which one(s) are you currently focusing on? \n\n<i>Psst.</i> Also, which one’s your favorite? I won’t tell.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Michael:</span>\n<p>\n\"I’m a technical architect and programmer, which made the backend, especially the adapters, a natural choice for me. It involves both contributing to the management plane, but also looking at and using service meshes from an architectural point of view. The possible implementations of service meshes is an area that has been particularly fascinating for me.\"\n</p>\n<p>\n\"I’d probably continue to work with the Meshery adapters for now before moving on to other areas of the project. Haha, I would probably name the Meshery Adapter Library as my favorite Layer5 project till date.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Shriti:</span>\n<p>Have you worked with any other open source project? How does Layer5 compare?</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Michael:</span>\n<p>\n\"I have worked and collaborated with several open source communities before, including Eclipse Modelling Framework and Apache ServiceMix . I couldn’t possibly make a very accurate comparison, given by limited interaction with other communities, but the Layer5 community stands out based on the unique and extremely inclusive approach it takes towards upholding community values.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Shriti:</span>\n<p>\nWhat is so fascinating about service meshes?\n</p>\n</div>\n<img className=\"right\" src={MoireCircles} />\n\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Michael:</span>\n<p>\n\"I find meshes intriguing in general. Meshes can look intricate, layered and complicated at a first glance, and yet they are built on the most basic principles. For me, meshes are visual structures, complete with an aesthetic and artistic dimension. \"\n</p>\n<p>\"Fun Fact: Overlapping meshes resulting in Moiré patterns are an example of this. They appealed to me from a young age, and I learned about their mathematics from my mathematics teacher.\"</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Shriti:</span>\n<p> \nFascinating. Why did you pick service meshes specifically though? \n</p>\n</div>\n\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Michael:</span>\n<p>\n\"An increasing number of applications nowadays consist of distributed services, both in the  cloud and on-premises, in mixed and hybrid environments.  Many legacy applications are in express need of modernisation, consuming and being consumed by cloud native applications.  Introducing microservices, also by refactoring monolithic applications, increases the complexity of the service landscape. By delegating cross-cutting infrastructure concerns like security, traffic management, resilience, and observability to the services mesh, some of the complexity is moved from the applications to the service mesh, allowing application developers to focus on business logic. A concern in these distributed, dynamic and scalable systems is that the security also needs to scale. If security doesn’t scale, it becomes very challenging to handle such systems. Services meshes today are already able to support many of these scenarios, and are continuously improving.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"Service meshes are complex but that is something I enjoy attempting as a challenge, to have control and overview and make it appear simple, investing into automating options. Another field that I’m excited to learn about continuously is related to  the security of distributed systems, and how service meshes contribute to implementing a  zero trust network architecture.\"\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\"I actually <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelgfeller/status/1289951164281233408\" target=\"nofollow\">dreamed about service mesh</a> a while ago. That was almost a bit spooky.”\n</p> \n</div>\n<img className=\"right\" src={MoireLines} />\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Shriti:</span>\n<p>Haha. Leading on that, what should Meshery dream about next? What can we hope to contribute to the service mesh landscape in your opinion?</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Michael:</span>\n<p> \n\"Meshery currently does a great job of providing a neutral platform. Continuing in that direction would be a superb base plan.  Enabling innovative applications from vendors, supporting all service meshes, integrating best practice methods, and implementing the SMP and SMI abstractions would probably score the top five positions in Meshery’s new year resolutions in 2021.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Shriti:</span>\n<p>\nInteresting. Do expand on that. What do you think Meshery could offer, in addition to what it already does?\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Michael:</span>\n<p> \n\"At the moment, Meshery provides a management plane solution and provides support for the SMI and <a href=\"https://smp-spec.io\">Service Mesh Performance</a> (SMP) specifications. Helpful additions in the future should be the configuration based best practices, especially with regards to security and to possibly extend to owning up specific routes on security. For instance by verifying that the recommendations outlined in the NIST report “Building Secure Microservices-based Applications Using Service-Mesh Architecture” by Ramaswamy Chandramouli and Zack Butcher.\"\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Shriti:</span>\n<p>\nWhat are today's challenges when working with service meshes?\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Michael:</span>\n<p>\n“I can’t claim to have worked with many implementations, and to have a good overview and wide experience. A lot of the complexity is already handled, but there is still enough to decide and implement for each solution. The solution makes for a challenging but highly interesting task. Additionally, there are a variety of different solutions from different vendors, which is excellent but it also makes it hard to know which would be the best fit for a given situation. Here, again, Meshery can be of invaluable help.”\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Shriti:</span>\n<p>\nThat’s good to hear. What do you think we should look forward to with respect to service mesh development?\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Michael:</span>\n<p> \nThe service mesh promise holds a lot of potential, for instance for modernization and ease of use. A lot appears to be happening these times. It will be interesting to see how serverless solutions will be integrated. Enabling a seamless implementation experience for solutions embracing multi-cloud, on-prem and legacy systems is also something to look forward to. Additionally, service meshes are aimed at making your architecture more secure and stable, which makes security a big concern for any service mesh provider. Improvements along these points will be topics I’ll be watching out for over the next few years.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Shriti:</span>\n<p>\n Ah while I have you here, let me get more reading recommendations lined up. Cloud Native and especially, the field of service meshes evolving exceptionally fast. Keeping up with all the developments can be challenging. Which resources do you use to stay up-to-date?\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Michael:</span>\n<p> \nService mesh implementations consist of many components, and I try to stay up to date in general.  Try to follow as much as possible conferences and vendor announcements, blog posts etc. mainly by following related Twitter accounts. Also, trying to find some time to explore various solutions. Lee’s books are of course an excellent source. Another book I can recommend is Zero Trust Networks book by Gilman and Barth. It really helped me to understand how service meshes relate to zero trust network architecture and can help to move towards it.\n</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Shriti:</span>\n<p> What does being a Meshery maintainer mean to you? How has being a maintainer impacted your full-time role?</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Michael:</span>\n<p> \n“I take my role as a Meshery maintainer with its benefits and responsibilities. For one, it means to be able to give back to the community. I meet a lot of interesting and friendly people from around the globe, learning about their culture at the same time. Additionally, Open Source allows me to work on and dive into tasks as I like, making it easy to integrate the work with my existing work schedule. It also allows me to learn a lot, expanding on my understanding of service meshes, keeping up with the latest developments in the field, and also giving me the opportunity to witness first-hand how others are using them. This has a quite direct impact on my full-time role, complementing the work I do.” \n</p>\n</div> \n\n<div className=\"interviewer\">\n<span>Shriti:</span>\n<p> Do you have any advice for individuals hopeful to become Layer5 contributors or potentially maintainers?</p>\n</div>\n\n<div className=\"interviewee\">\n<span>Michael:</span>\n<p> \n\"A general love for software development combined with a readiness to help out newcomers and participating in the growing community is the key.\n</p>\n<p>\nCome and visit, there is something for everyone, be it frontend, backend, CI/CD, website, documentation, standards, interfacing with other communities, and more. The friendly community members and the meshmates will provide support and guidance.

As a reliably test tool, Cypress  works with <i>ReactJS</i>, <i>VueJS</i>, <i>AngularJS</i> and so on; it is agnostic of the framework you use. You can write all types of tests: <i>end-to-end</i>, <i>integration</i>, and <i>unit tests</i>.\n\nTests allow you to ensure that the new code do not break the current one. They help you to develop and integrate new features faster and ensure everything will work after including your changes. The more tests you have, the more coverage you will have (and less likelihood of issues in production).\n\n### UI tests in Meshery\n\nMeshery has two web projects:\n\n- <b>provider-ui:</b> A <i>ReactJS</i> app that allows you to select the Provider to be used for Meshery\n- <b>ui:</b> Also a <i>ReactJS</i> app where you can do everything related with Meshery. It is the cloud native management plane.\n\nWe create UI tests for both projects using Cypress. Also, we write two types of UI tests at the moment:\n- <b>Integration:</b> Test a specific functionality without backend communication (mocking requests and responses)\n- <b>End-to-end:</b> Test a whole flow like setting up Linkerd Service Mesh or running a SMI Performance Test sending requests and validating the responses from the back-end\n\n### How to write UI tests for Meshery\n\nIf you are writting your first test, you can read and watch the <b><u><a href=\"https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test.html\">great getting started</a></u></b> from Cypress blog.\n\nThen, you have to add your test below `\"provider-ui/cypress/integration\"` or `\"ui/cypress/integration\"` folders (do not forget adding <i>_spec</i> in the filename).\n\nHere is a basic example of a test validating that <b>Provider UI component</b> exists:\n\n```\ndescribe('Provider UI', () => {\n  it('renders provider component', () => {\n    cy\n      .get('[data-cy=root]')\n      .should('exist')\n  })\n})\n```\n\nPlease follow the <b><u><a href=\"https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html\">best practices recommended</a></u></b> by Cypress.\nOne of the most important is to use or add the `\"data-cy\"` attribute to the element you want to interact to:\n\n<img src={bestPracticesSelectingElementsImg} className=\"image-center\" alt=\"Best Practices selecting elements with Cypress\" />\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}>Best Practices Selecting Elements</p>\n\n### Run your test!\n\nOnce you have written your test, it is time to execute it locally:\n\n1. First, you have to run the back-end executing this command at the root project folder:\n\n```bash\n$ make run-local\n```\n\n2.

Being fairly new\n    to the world of open source and looking for new communities and technology to\n    delve into, I hopped onto the Layer5 bandwagon and was amazed by the warm\n    welcome I received from the wholesome community. I had done video animation\n    jobs on a small scale before, which is what led me to confidently take up the\n    task of creating a short intro jingle for the various community meetings\n    hosted on the Layer5 youtube channel. After iterating for about a week, I\n    finally came up with something worthwhile. And to my elation, it was accepted!\n    It still warms my heart to see the intro flash before every meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Next up I started work on a next generation model of the layer5.io site. Being\n    a new project based on Gatsby and heavily relying on React, Javascript and\n    GraphQL, the site project was a perfect and challenging opportunity for me to\n    expand on my skill set. Speed learning my way through Gatsby, with a\n    continuous influx of help and helpful suggestions from my MeshMate, Kush\n    Trivedi and others within the community, I soon mastered the platform and have\n    spent weeks on creating countless issues and PRs in hopes of achieving the\n    project goals. A few months down the line, I started reviewing PRs and began\n    helping others contribute, something which I had never had the opportunity to\n    do before! After months of continuous effort, I am proud to write that I\n    recently joined as a maintainer on the project and was soon approached to be a\n    MeshMate, which I happily accepted. My learning graph has seen a soaring\n    positive tangent in the months I have been at Layer5 and I’m looking forward\n    to an even more educative and rewarding journey ahead 😊\n  </p>\n  <br />\n  <h4>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/kelechi-nwachukwu\">\n      Kelechi Precious Nwachukwu\n    </Link>\n  </h4>\n  <img\n    src={ Kelechi }\n    className=\"image-right\"\n    alt=\"kelechi-precious\"\n  />\n  <p>\n    It was the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and being unproductive wasn't\n    something I can stomach. Wanting to expand on my technical domain knowledge, I\n    stumbled across an open-source challenge for women in tech with lists of\n    projects to contribute to by the Women of Open Source Community Africa\n    (WOSCA). My eyes landed on Layer5 and I haven’t looked back since.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    A quick look through the repositories left me quaking in my boots. To give you\n    some much needed context and to give some hope to all the newbies out there, I\n    recently transitioned to working in technical domains from accounting and\n    managing construction site projects. Forever getting stuck trying to get my\n    hands on new tech and trying to find a way into the bewildering and humongous\n    tech domains , I didn't even understand some of the jargon, and was too\n    ashamed to ask questions. Stumbling through my first contribution, I somehow\n    made it to the finish line and to my happiness, was soon assigned another\n    task. Instead of complaining, I set out to study up on the issue and took a\n    peek at the other assignees in the repository to ensure that I was not the\n    only one taking inordinate amounts of time on an issue. To my surprise, I was\n    not.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    I got working on the assignment and soon encountered issues that would\n    previously have made me quit. Thankfully, I decided to take a different\n    approach this time. I shared my challenge with the Layer5 community, and was\n    amazed at the immediate and abundant response I received. Since then, I have\n    helped other contributors get through their challenges, and have received an\n    invitation to join the organization as a member, and then as a MeshMate 😎 I\n    have been wholly satisfied with the learning opportunities and the friendly\n    environment that the Layer5 community has to offer. I have learned that I may\n    not be perfect, but by making full use of the resources provided to me, having\n    a supportive community by my side and by being open to learning and showing\n    determined courage in the face of difficulties, I can achieve anything!\n  </p>\n  <h4>\n    <Link className=\"mute\" to=\"/community/members/ruth-ikegah\"> Ruth Ikegah </Link>\n  </h4>\n  <img\n    src={ Ruth }\n    className=\"image-right\"\n    alt=\"ruth-ikegah\"\n  />\n  <p>\n    The field of open source had always been intriguing to me. The idea of a\n    close-knit community working with an aim had me wanting to contribute myself.\n    Considering the fact that I have a small skill set (Donned the coder hat only\n    6 months ago), Layer5 was a great community for me to start out with. I came\n    to know about the Layer5 community from the She Code Africa slack channel,\n    after which I visited the <Link to=\"https://github.com/layer5io\">GitHub repository</Link> and hopped on to the Layer5 slack channel.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    To my good luck, I received a warm welcome from the community and was able to attend a community meeting the day I joined. I made my way through the Github repos and stumbled across a beginner friendly issue. I started work but to my dismay, my PR failed to pass the DCO check at the final rung. Stuck and with low spirits, I talked to Lee (Layer5 Maintainer) and related my problems with the DCO check fail. He patiently assured me that first-time checks can be hard to get right and assigned me a MeshMate, Ashis Singh (read saviour 😳). I sent a message to Ashis and told him about the issues I was having in submitting my Pull Request. He led me through a step by step tutorial on committing and signing off my changes, after which my first PR passed all the checks. I was thrilled at this point, waiting for my PR to be merged. I soon received two emails, the first relaying that my PR had been merged and a few pull requests later, a second one with an invitation to join the Layer5 organization on Github.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Impressed by the process and being passionate about helping others, I soon\n    began helping out with welcoming newcomers in the Layer5 Community and a happy two months later, I am elated to write that I have helped and held the hand of many-a contributors into Open-Source, offering them the same warm welcome that I had received. I was soon promoted to become a MeshMate. Apart from adding another feather to my cap, this also helped me enhance my own skill set and reach in a dozen different directions.The most intriguing fact about the Layer5 community is how welcoming it is. You can contribute something, even as a beginner, no matter how small your skillset is. I have been through the same journey and I recommend it to everyone reading. Experience an open-source community with Layer5 today! Once you’re set up on Slack, do send me a ping to\n    say hi. The exciting part, we might even meet as MeshMates 😉\n  </p>\n\n  \\- Tanuj, Ruth, and Kelechi\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing a new line of MeshMates","date":"Sep 25th, 2020","author":"Our MeshMates with 🤍","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsQAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSBIAAAABD/D5/4iIIBBI2t98goj+RzxWUDggjAAAADAEAJ0BKhQADQA+0VSkS6gko6GwCAEAGglmALsAIeAs4yLj2ZvcYlj7AAD+8ipNYFLcPFqHT1eYGDWdbvsC9m9jlOUn318vJQJCfVdIx/lCmDiy//hGBYHfqa/bUAwSV/VFKhAxNUpsy8CPAYGXQIQGrPPnAYpjnVQWB/icfDL/mPvzHvOUT8bQAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp","srcSet":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/c2fca/meshmate-announcement.webp 750w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/9acda/meshmate-announcement.webp 1080w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/238d8/meshmate-announcement.webp 1366w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp 1500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6733333333333333}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/meshmate-announcement.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsQAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSBIAAAABD/D5/4iIIBBI2t98goj+RzxWUDggjAAAADAEAJ0BKhQADQA+0VSkS6gko6GwCAEAGglmALsAIeAs4yLj2ZvcYlj7AAD+8ipNYFLcPFqHT1eYGDWdbvsC9m9jlOUn318vJQJCfVdIx/lCmDiy//hGBYHfqa/bUAwSV/VFKhAxNUpsy8CPAYGXQIQGrPPnAYpjnVQWB/icfDL/mPvzHvOUT8bQAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp","srcSet":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/c2fca/meshmate-announcement.webp 750w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/9acda/meshmate-announcement.webp 1080w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/238d8/meshmate-announcement.webp 1366w,\n/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/b4569/meshmate-announcement.webp 1500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.6733333333333333}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/aa8d30949781bb02b1257eb95d7d2184/meshmate-announcement.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/announcements/announcing-a-new-line-of-meshmates"}},{"id":"7802e907-ecf2-5e60-93ed-04551ee7687f","body":"\n\nimport smpImg from \"./smp.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n### What is performance benchmarking and why should you care?\n\nMany of you may remember that the HBO streaming service crashed when the final season of the popular sitcom, Game of Thrones went live on the service. Unable to engage all the user requests, the streaming service and the website broke down and ultimately resulted in DoS (Denial of Service). There are numerous examples of service crashes across different platforms, which has forced developers to take a closer look at performance benchmarking and pre-launch performance checks.\n\nThere are several advantages of preliminary service benchmarking, which may extensively enhance the response time, resolve glitches, enhance the application's robustness, and bring together several other commendable factors, including but not limited to stability and dependability within an application.\n\nThere are several tools for performance benchmarking. A major one is the interconnected relationship between load generators and benchmarks. Some of the well-known load generators in the cloud native realm are:\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Fortio</li>\n    <li>Wrk2/Wrk</li>\n    <li><a href=\"/projects/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</a></li>\n</ul>\n\nThe conclusion can be encapsulated as following, Meshery, the cloud native management plane possesses the ability to generate load and benchmark services in/out of your service mesh using Fortio, Wrk2 and now, Nighthawk too.\n\n### Meshery + Nighthawk = Robust Distributed and Scalable Services\n\nNighthawk, written and maintained by the Envoy Community, is a L7 (HTTP/HTTPS/HTTP2) performance characterization tool that supports performance benchmarking using HTTP or gRPC services.\n\nNighthawk is built using open-source builds and test tool Bazel and supports output formatting to well-known formats, allowing integration with other systems and dashboards. To add more to the list, it will soon support distributed performance benchmarking which is currently under an active development stage.\n\nOn the other hand, Meshery, written and maintainer by Layer5 Community is the multi-service mesh management plane offering lifecycle, configuration and performance management of service meshes and their workloads. With Meshery, you can both, manage your service mesh's lifecycle, and benchmark them with industry-grade tools to let you know how much under or over-utilized your services are.\n\n<img src={smpImg} alt=\"smp-image\" className=\"image-left smp-image\"/>\n\nSoon, Meshery is going to be a canonical implementation for [Service Mesh Performance](https://github.com/layer5io/service-mesh-performance) which is a common and standardised format to describe : - Performance test configuration - Service mesh configuration - Environment configuration - Workload configuration - Performance test results.\n\n### How did we achieve it ?\nThe following project was proposed as a Google Summer of Code Idea, I was selected as a student mentee to draft the design, architecture and code my way from scratch. On my journey, I received guidance from some amazing mentors, colleagues and open-source stake holders. I discussed the design proposal with Envoy Team as well as Layer5 Team and from suggestions from both, I was able to complete my project.\n\nIn the course of the project, I came up with the idea of invoking Nighthawk as a separate container with which Meshery will communicate using a go-lang based middleware.\n\nTo my elation, the project was a huge success and Nighthawk is now invoked as a load-generator in Meshery. Soon, the public release for the new version will be made and users will be able to utilize Nighthawk as a performance-benchamark tool alongside with Fortio and Wrk2.\n\n### What's next?\nThis is just the first relay, in the long run, there are many more milestones to come. The following is a list of projects which will be completed in upcoming months:\n\n- Invoke Nighthawk as an gRPC Service and support gRPC connection between Nighthawk & Meshery.\n- Implement user-profiles for performance benchmarking which may store some preset preferred values according to users.\n- Enhance Nighthawk to support distributed load generation and performance benchmarking.\n- NATS & gRPC Performance Benchmarking for gRPC and NATS services invoked in Meshery.\n\nand many more awesome and bleeding-edge ideas.\n\n### How can I get involved?\nIf any of this sounds remotely exciting, I implore you to give this a chance. You won’t regret it. Head over to our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and join the #performance channel where everything related to performance testing is discussed. We would love to hear your feedback. Stay tuned for more blogs related to Performance Benchmarking, SMI Conformance and all things meshy!!!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Performance benchmarking using Meshery and Nighthawk","date":"Sep 19th, 2020","author":"Layer5 Team","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRj4AAABXRUJQVlA4IDIAAADwAgCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYwCdAC0kAAD+8Ft1agncm7Dve5aKGf5sAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/5711e/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/4a552/mesheryctl.webp 750w,\n/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/571ff/mesheryctl.webp 1080w,\n/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/1866d/mesheryctl.webp 1366w,\n/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/5711e/mesheryctl.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42552083333333335}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/mesheryctl.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRj4AAABXRUJQVlA4IDIAAADwAgCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYwCdAC0kAAD+8Ft1agncm7Dve5aKGf5sAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/5711e/mesheryctl.webp","srcSet":"/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/4a552/mesheryctl.webp 750w,\n/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/571ff/mesheryctl.webp 1080w,\n/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/1866d/mesheryctl.webp 1366w,\n/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/5711e/mesheryctl.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42552083333333335}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/093f9cfbcb5c36ac072615fe97352342/mesheryctl.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/performance/performance-benchmarking-using-meshery-and-nighthawk"}},{"id":"41186fe5-9702-5f79-9115-7013aba6492e","body":"\n\nimport conformance from \"./conformance-results.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nReleased on August 5th, 2020 by Microsoft, [Open Service Mesh](https://openservicemesh.io/) (OSM) is a lightweight and [Service Mesh Interace conformant](https://layer5.io/smi) (SMI). Open Service Mesh is a contemporary addition to the [service mesh landscape](/service-mesh-landscape). Using Envoy as its data plane proxy component and SMI specifications as it's control plane APIs, OSM draws lessons and code from existing service mesh projects, like Linkerd. The Open Service Mesh project has some miles to go as it is one of a growing list of choices available in the service mesh landscape.\n\nFirst pronounced to be SMI compliant by [Meshery](https://meshery.io/), the cloud native management plane, the first release of OSM supports a myriad of basic\n\n<ul>\n    <li>Securing service to service links</li>\n    <li>Supporting traffic shifting</li>\n    <li>Managing observability for your services</li>\n    <li>Validating and Implementing access control policies</li>\n    <li>Auto addition of applications and services</li>\n</ul>\n\n### Get started with OSM using Meshery\nIn Layer5's effort to support our multi-mesh world, our Meshery project provides an effortless way for Kubernetes operators to install, maintain and run service meshes. [Meshery v0.4.3](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery/releases/tag/v0.4.3) includes the [Meshery Adapter for Open Service Mesh](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-osm), enabling you to quickly provision OSM, run any number of sample applications, manage its performance using [Service Mesh Performance](https://smp-spec.io/) (SMP), validate OSM's compliance to SMI using a suite of conformance tests. Meshery offers configuraiton management with builtin best practice configuration analysis giving you confidence in applying custom configuration to OSM. Meshery's documenation on the [Open Service Mesh integation](https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/osm) provides a complete walkthrough on how to get set up, install, deploy and configure OSM according to your needs.\n\n<img src={conformance} className=\"\" alt=\"meshery-smi-conformance-results-image\" />\n\nTry Open Service Mesh now, by [getting started with Meshery](/cloud-native-management/meshery/getting-started).\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing the Meshery Adapter for Open Service Mesh","date":"Aug 20th, 2020","author":"Lee Calcote","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABQAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBdgBDvIHyHlAAD+9R5BqQSsiWNeJNqE7PLbzQ9M/Tvb9CSqaIr+n2R5upIraZpU7CzXHZesE7BZyYNioCJXqMKKJGxFbL89G+X6eR3+pLo8zCJoAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1e896538fdd2f9faaa30e0b7dd7f2f6a/770cd/meshery-open-service.webp","srcSet":"/static/1e896538fdd2f9faaa30e0b7dd7f2f6a/280d5/meshery-open-service.webp 750w,\n/static/1e896538fdd2f9faaa30e0b7dd7f2f6a/5b49f/meshery-open-service.webp 1080w,\n/static/1e896538fdd2f9faaa30e0b7dd7f2f6a/f8bdf/meshery-open-service.webp 1366w,\n/static/1e896538fdd2f9faaa30e0b7dd7f2f6a/770cd/meshery-open-service.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5010416666666666}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/1e896538fdd2f9faaa30e0b7dd7f2f6a/meshery-open-service.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnwAAABXRUJQVlA4IHAAAABQAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBdgBDvIHyHlAAD+9R5BqQSsiWNeJNqE7PLbzQ9M/Tvb9CSqaIr+n2R5upIraZpU7CzXHZesE7BZyYNioCJXqMKKJGxFbL89G+X6eR3+pLo8zCJoAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/1e896538fdd2f9faaa30e0b7dd7f2f6a/770cd/meshery-open-service.webp","srcSet":"/static/1e896538fdd2f9faaa30e0b7dd7f2f6a/280d5/meshery-open-service.webp 750w,\n/static/1e896538fdd2f9faaa30e0b7dd7f2f6a/5b49f/meshery-open-service.webp 1080w,\n/static/1e896538fdd2f9faaa30e0b7dd7f2f6a/f8bdf/meshery-open-service.webp 1366w,\n/static/1e896538fdd2f9faaa30e0b7dd7f2f6a/770cd/meshery-open-service.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5010416666666666}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/1e896538fdd2f9faaa30e0b7dd7f2f6a/meshery-open-service.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/open-service-mesh/announcing-the-meshery-adapter-for-open-service-mesh"}},{"id":"bd19c992-298c-515b-b2d6-0288d77ab971","body":"\n\nimport SignedBook from \"./pic2.jpeg\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nGetting involved in something new and essentially avant garde, can be a messy challenge to navigate through. But, when it comes to contributing to Meshery it only gets more and more meshy!\n\n### Get set go!\n\nI was introduced to the world of open source through the <a href=\"https://meshery.io/\" >Meshery</a> project in the august of 2019 and have since then been continuously exploring the farthest reaches of Meshery, Layer5, the parent SMI project and consecutively the CNCF landscape.\n\nAt the time of writing this, I have been a part of the Meshery project for about a year. Fascinated by the concept and further lured in by the welcoming community at Layer5, I was soon dipping my toes into the tidal wave of code. Starting out with small contributions to improve the UI, I stumbled on to my first issue, which was to open a page in a new tab instead of opening it in the same tab. Basic, right?\n\nI’m pointing this out to unravel the myth and smoke clouds around open source projects. Contributing can be as easy as altering a few lines of code and can be as meaningful as writing a whole new feature adapter. Since then, I have crossed small and big hurdles, meandering through countless issues and have become a part of the wholesome community, gaining friends and mentors along the way.\n\n### Stepping stones\n\nLet’s begin with the basics. What is Layer5?\n\nLayer5 is the service mesh company, which has built (or is in the process of building) an exhaustive set of projects to delve into the world of cloud native and service meshes with in-depth analyses. Intrigued? Checkout the [Layer5](https://layer5.io/) site and hop on to our [GitHub](https://github.com/layer5io) bandwagon. Before you do me the favor of reading on, make sure to click on the little star :star: button to help us stir up some more delectable meshiness.\n\n### Roadblocks\n\nComing to my contributions at Layer5, I have mostly been involved in improving the UI and shaping the company site’s present outlook. I have also tried my hand at other projects, including the `mesheryctl` and the `landscape` at Layer5. In fact, here is a comprehensive list of **[my contributions across Layer5 projects](https://github.com/issues?page=1&q=is%3Aclosed+author%3ANikhil-Ladha+org%3Alayer5io)**.\n\nThe above mentioned links are just the **visible** contributions made by me. With time, I have grown and was soon approached to become a [MeshMate](/community/meshmates), an initiative which involves few seasoned contributors like me who will hold the hand of a new member and help him/her bridge the gap and take the leap into open source.\n\n### Tricks of the Trade\n\nThe benefits of being a UI engineer?\n\nWeb developers are required in every company in one meaningful way or the other as every single project needs a frontend to showcase it’s capabilities to the user. Coming to Layer5, the frontend of Meshery is built on React( another masterpiece from Facebook! ), which I learned from scratch when I joined the community.\n\n<img src={SignedBook} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"Nikhil-ladha-work\" />\n\nNow, months have passed and with some healthy dedication and hours of staring at thousands of lines of code, I have a good base and practical experience with React, something which you can’t hope to gain from personal projects and require a community for.\n\nThe Layer5 and Meshery websites are built using Jekyll, another technology about which I didn’t have any practical knowledge a couple of months ago. Easier than react and harder than CSS, Jekyll is perfect for the aspiring web developers out there and is also another reason for you to pop over to the Layer5 repo after reading this article.\n\n### Meshy goodness<br/>\n\nMy experience at Layer5 has made me proud of the work that we do and has challenged me time and again to reach for higher goals. I still have a hunch that someway or the other my contributions are responsible for getting me an internship at Red Hat! All heads bowed to [Lee Calcote](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leecalcote/) for his presence and guidance and to the Layer5 community for being as amazing as it is. My journey at Layer5 has been an ever growing curve to be honest from just a contributor to a MeshMate to the maintainer of few projects at Layer5. And, true to god this wouldn’t have been possible without the combined effort from me and our very own Lee Calcote. His trust and confidence in me is what encourages me to contribute more and more at Layer5 and see it grow to some next level in the coming future.\nMotivated or moved or still confused?\n\nWant to experience the same feeling and see yourself recognized as an Open-source contributor?\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My journey from a contributor to a maintainer!","date":"Aug 11th, 2020","author":"Nikhil Ladha","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRtoAAABXRUJQVlA4IM4AAABQBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpUyoJSOiKA1RABoJYgDI1Yu4cZ+e0+pja27uGOaFSA2pv+3H4AAA/vTkqvcwUCcjvbhwbG6sZ3kzQnN0KTdKluuU3w2/BClnZtkkXiRRbaguR251znRqd15PMzc8wpWj3kPMW428TI+J/Ezuh+RS7a1ME5hYrStZzy/2yj9kPRHQhbx/REKhpm/U6mPYzPaWSmtZHe0go+1FoNK4gkyNchV9ldIOwjzd1GlqxQOKCugq9GSihcXFB8/BkticRAAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp","srcSet":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f03f/pic1.webp 750w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f506/pic1.webp 1080w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/pic1.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRtoAAABXRUJQVlA4IM4AAABQBQCdASoUABQAPtFYpUyoJSOiKA1RABoJYgDI1Yu4cZ+e0+pja27uGOaFSA2pv+3H4AAA/vTkqvcwUCcjvbhwbG6sZ3kzQnN0KTdKluuU3w2/BClnZtkkXiRRbaguR251znRqd15PMzc8wpWj3kPMW428TI+J/Ezuh+RS7a1ME5hYrStZzy/2yj9kPRHQhbx/REKhpm/U6mPYzPaWSmtZHe0go+1FoNK4gkyNchV9ldIOwjzd1GlqxQOKCugq9GSihcXFB8/BkticRAAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp","srcSet":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f03f/pic1.webp 750w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/4f506/pic1.webp 1080w,\n/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/83805/pic1.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/8855eefb5fd222d10075a6eb93f2c10e/pic1.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/my-journey-from-a-contributor-to-a-maintainer"}},{"id":"ea2400da-2d3b-59c7-be79-7831ba9fc7fc","body":"\n\nimport operator from \"./meshery-operator-dark.svg\";\nimport MesheryArchitecture from \"./meshery-architecture.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n[Meshery](https://meshery.io) is the cloud native management plane offering lifecycle, configuration and performance management of service meshes and their workloads.\n\nLayer5 community members are hard at work providing our users with easy access to any service mesh and myriad management features. New releases for Meshery are published on a frequent cadence with new features and bug fixes. Today, we are announcing version 0.4.0 of Meshery. This summary highlights Meshery's latest developments and elucidates new features.\n\n## What's New?\n\nThe v0.4.0 release of Meshery introduces a plethora of new features and bug fixes across service mesh environments spanning Meshery and it's various adapters.\n\n### Meshery's CLI: `mesheryctl`\n**New Command Structure**<br/>\n`mesheryctl` commands and subcommands have been restructured in v0.4.0 into the categories:\n- Global Commands and Flags\n- Meshery Lifecycle Management\n- Performance Management\n- Service Mesh Lifecycle Management\n- Workload Lifecycle Management\n\nOrganizing commnands [under these categories](https://docs.meshery.io/reference/mesheryctl) is done with both the intention to make `mesheryctl` functions intuitively at your fingertips, but also to make room for forthcoming functionality.\n\n**Exposing Performance Management in the CLI**<br/>\n`perf:` a new `mesheryctl`command. Introduction of new performance sub-commands, now benchmark your service mesh at the tip of your fingers using our new CLI command `perf`.\n\n**Support for Scoop** <br/>\nSupport extended to Scoop Bucket. You can now install mesheryctl on your Windows machine with Scoop Bucket. Visit the [Meshery Scoop Bucket](https://github.com/layer5io/scoop-bucket) to install Meshery on Windows.\n\n**Rename `cleanup` to `reset`**<br/>\nThe `cleanup` is used to reset your Meshery deployment configuration back to its default settings. This command has been renamed to `reset` to more appropriately reflect its purpose.\n\n### MeshSync<br/>\n<img src={operator} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"meshery-operator-dark\" />\n\n-  A component of the [Meshery Operator](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-operator), MeshSync can scan the environment to get the deployment details of specific types of service meshes and the connected Kubernetes cluster.\n-  MeshSync is a new component addition to Meshery. Meshery needs to be constantly updated given that service meshes and their underlying infrastructure are dynamic, constantly changing.  Meshery operations should be resilient in the face of this change.\n-  MeshSync brings a service mesh agnostic object model that defines relationships between all objects under management.\n\n### Meshery Adapter for Citrix Service Mesh (beta)<br/>\n\n<img src={MesheryArchitecture} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"meshery-architecture\" />\n\n- [Citrix Service Mesh](https://github.com/layer5io/meshery-cpx) is now a supported service mesh. Meshery incorporates support for the Citrix ADC CPX, which is a cloud-ready, container-based application delivery controller that can be provisioned on a Docker host.\n- CPX runs as the Istio Data Plane component, displacing Envoy as the default data plane service proxy.<br/>\n\n### Security & Authentication\n\n- Meshery has moved from using session authentication to JWT authentication. Meshery's JWT authentication is powered by Hydra Auth.\n- You can now opt to authenticate yourself on mesheryctl while performing performance tests using `mesheryctl`, you can authenticate yourself by getting the JWT Token from Meshery UI.\n\n### Meshery Server\n\n- Support provided for [wrk2 as an alternative load generator](https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management#load-generators).\n- [Providers](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility) - A new project construct that allows users to select authentication, long-term storage etc.\n- Ad-hoc [connectivity tests for Prometheus and Grafana](https://docs.meshery.io/functionality/performance-management#grafana-and-meshery) are now supported.\n- Extraneous information beyond IP address and port in Grafana and Prometheus endpoints have been stripped off.\n\n### Meshery UI\n\n- ES-Lint has been added to the client side to ensure the quality of code and increase maintainaiblity of code.\n- Cypress has been set-up to enable end-to-end tests and integration tests for Meshery UI.\n\n<center><iframe frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowFullScreen={true} mozallowFullScreen=\"true\" webkitallowFullScreen=\"true\"frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowFullScreen={true} mozallowFullScreen=\"true\" webkitallowFullScreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ds9D2KgZKxo\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe></center>\n\n\n### Other notable changes\n\n- From within the [Meshery Continuous Integration Working Group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ds9D2KgZKxo&list=PL3A-A6hPO2IM7rYiKxG4l3eQNc6X3IUex), we have strengthened our continuous integration (CI) actions & tests by introducing new workflows like `static check`, `vet check`, `security check` for our server code.\n- ReleaseDrafter & WelcomeBot has been added to the repository to enable automation of release notes and for welcoming new contributors, respectively.\n\nTo get a more comprehensive list of the bug fixes and enhancements packaged in the v0.4.0 release, see the [Meshery Documentation](https://docs.meshery.io/project/releases)\n\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Announcing Meshery v0.4.0","date":"Aug 7th, 2020","author":"Layer5 Team","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsoAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSGYAAAABgCsAgIHqqtHm5JrcZNvWxqvd2GwbYz1u7yf5ARGR4N+JIZRCqIZQBSQ+aIdJPY+dC3seH6nRZlTtfN27zv5n8B0Vs5jm+2qmdSqD7LBa0lUQRfBdDgvPIlGJVCQJR0JTiTjw/wBWUDggPgAAADADAJ0BKhQADQA+0VakS6gko6GwCAEAGglpAAB60b/b/AAA/vAi9+Ax+ANYXYVXicTSFmjmW1J3l211gAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp","srcSet":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp 500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.666}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/meshery-v040.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRsoAAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAADAAAQUxQSGYAAAABgCsAgIHqqtHm5JrcZNvWxqvd2GwbYz1u7yf5ARGR4N+JIZRCqIZQBSQ+aIdJPY+dC3seH6nRZlTtfN27zv5n8B0Vs5jm+2qmdSqD7LBa0lUQRfBdDgvPIlGJVCQJR0JTiTjw/wBWUDggPgAAADADAJ0BKhQADQA+0VakS6gko6GwCAEAGglpAAB60b/b/AAA/vAi9+Ax+ANYXYVXicTSFmjmW1J3l211gAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp","srcSet":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/921bf/meshery-v040.webp 500w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.666}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/af2d9c15a09697b2ad48556b58102cd8/meshery-v040.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/announcements/announcing-meshery-v040"}},{"id":"a45a606d-6f4a-5ecd-883a-d61a271c015d","body":"\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nI started a new job at [RemoteState](https://www.linkedin.com/company/remotestate/) as a software development engineer in May of 2020.\nPost the initial plunge, settling into the role was relatively easier for me due to the experience I had gained in working on open source contributions in the Layer5 community. My experience with open source had also been a big plus for me throughout the application and interview process.

The Layer5 community offers a number of resources to contributors, including these two decks ([Meshery - the cloud native management plane](https://layer5.io/meshery) and [Layer5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tLcMcyQ-Z6YYISYyR0Eyb30dojQiKHIjs7Rt5m8kcag/edit?usp=sharing) that I drew from as a basis for a personalized presentation and demonstration to my new team.\n\n<center>\n<iframe src=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQNpnp_SIkYNMe1rx-Cw_armxHRmQvkcp8d3BVML6XEhsSgy7k0w9xDKrGGs4EPew/embed?start=true&loop=true&delayms=3000\" loading=\"lazy\" frameBorder=\"0\" width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" allowFullScreen={true} mozallowFullScreen=\"true\" webkitallowFullScreen=\"true\"></iframe></center>\n\nWhen the day arrived to present the concepts of service meshes, Meshery, and other cloud native initiatives to my team, I held a Google Meet with a full attendance. I started the session with a reader’s digest version of microservices and service meshes to set the stage for any newcomers to the world of cloud native, I went on to elaborate on Layer5 ‘s contributions to the CNCF landscape and the SMI project. This was followed by an in-depth discussion on data planes, control planes, and management planes. I spoke at-length about Meshery’s functionality including, its features for facilitating the benchmarking, interoperability and standardization of service meshes. I wrapped up the session with some insider tips that I have learned in my months as an open source contributor in the Layer5 community. In the stream of feedback received from my colleagues, the session seems to have been a success.\n\nThis whole experience has been an amazing journey for me. From being a complete noob to utilizing my expertise in the service mesh domain to landing an actual job, the experience has been a maze of ups and downs. But, I feel like I have finally arrived and arrived with a pot of gold. I’m eternally grateful to Lee Calcote for motivating me and providing me with the appropriate resources. Entering and exploring an open source community can be a daunting task and the [resources provided by Layer5](https://layer5.io/community/newcomers) helped them in overcoming that challenge and enabled them to learn more about the widespread work of [Meshery](https://meshery.io).\n\nI’m glad to have found a community that not only feeds my professional success, but also my personal growth. It’s not out of obligation, but out of a sense of gratitude and paying it forward to others (a tenant of the Layer5 community) that I now spend much of my time as a MeshMate. I help welcome and guide other new contributors along their open source path as they learn and grow. Giving to others and while continuing to grow professionally and personally is time well spent.   I encourage you to join me and others in the Layer5 community by jumping into our [Slack](https://slack.layer5.io/) to start meshing around!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"How I schooled my seniors","date":"Aug 4th, 2020","author":"Nupur Thakur","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/c4cb5205bb734ebc992ae0a25341c6bc/feature-image.svg"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/c4cb5205bb734ebc992ae0a25341c6bc/feature-image.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/how-i-schooled-my-seniors"}},{"id":"47a58ab5-c67e-52d4-ae1d-1623eeab8aed","body":"\n\nimport listioLayer5 from \"./layer5-and-istio.webp\";\nimport img1 from \"./image1.webp\";\nimport img2 from \"./image2.webp\";\nimport img3 from \"./image3.webp\";\nimport img4 from \"./image4.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img src={listioLayer5} className=\"image-left\" alt=\"Layer5 and Istio\" />\n\nRecently, I started learning on Service Mesh and it was a very interesting journey as I explored the Service Mesh\nlandscape starting with [Layer5 tutorials](https://github.com/layer5io/istio-service-mesh-workshop) and by exploring\nthe blogs at [Istio.io](https://istio.io/).\n\nOur organization decided to use the features of Istio for securing, managing and automating microservices. However, we have to support a multi-tenant environment and that became a challenge due to lack of sufficient documentation and clarity. To give a little bit of background on the problem, we have a single cluster with multiple tenants in different namespaces sharing the same cluster . We do not want to provide each tenant their own separate Kubernetes Cluster because that would be additional provisioning overhead, management overhead and also additional resource overhead on the platform.\n\nIn this blog, I will go over the concepts and visual representation as well as the steps to learn and build your setup.\nNow there are different combinations possible depending on the requirements. These could be :\n\n1. Single Istio Control Plane with its own Ingress-Gateway to ensure traffic for the control plane is coming via the same control plane Ingress-Gateway.\n1. One or more Workspace namespaces for the workload applications and each with its own instance of the ingress gateway\n1. More advanced scenario would be multiple Control Plane and its associated Data Plane or essentially Multiple Service Mesh within a single Kubernetes Cluster. This is presently feasible using the Maistra Istio Operator, but its not fully supported using the upstream Istio at present. I intend to go over this use case in a later article.\n\nHere by Ingress Gateway we mean the Istio Ingress Gateway and not the Kubernetes Ingress Gateway.\nNow, before we get into the steps for building an Istio Multi-tenant setup, lets quickly review the prerequisite :\n\n- Kubernetes setup (in the steps below I am using v1.18 on ubuntu 18.04)\n\n  ```sh\n  $ sudo apt-get install -y docker.io\n  $ sudo sh -c “echo ‘deb http://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main’ >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list”\n  $ sudo sh -c “curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | apt-key add -”\n  $ sudo apt-get update\n  $ sudo apt-get install -y kubeadm=1.18.1–00 kubelet=1.18.1–00 kubectl=1.18.1–00\n  $ sudo kubeadm init — kubernetes-version 1.18.1 — pod-network-cidr 192.168.0.0/16\n  $ mkdir -p $HOME/.kube\n  $ sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config\n  $ sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config\n  $ kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/manifests/calico.yaml\n  ```\n\n- Get the latest istioctl binary\n\n  ```sh\n  $ curl -L https://git.io/getLatestIstio | sh -\n  cd istio-*\n  export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH\n  istioctl version\n  ```\n\n- Initialize the Istio Operator\n  ```sh\n  $ istioctl operator init\n  Using operator Deployment image: docker.io/istio/operator:1.6.3\n  ✔ Istio operator installed\n  ✔ Installation complete\n  $ kubectl get all -n istio-operator\n  NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\n  pod/istio-operator-5998f6c744-vrkbk 1/1 Running 1 78m\n  NAME TYPE CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE\n  service/istio-operator ClusterIP 10.107.183.94 <none> 8383/TCP 78m\n  NAME READY UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE\n  deployment.apps/istio-operator 1/1 1 1 78m\n  NAME DESIRED CURRENT READY AGE\n  replicaset.apps/istio-operator-5998f6c744 1 1 1 78m\n  ```\n\nNext we will look into the details of the multitenancy scenarios; but before that a few word on the Istio operator would be nice. The Istio Operator follows the Kubernetes Controller and Custom Resource Definition mechanism and basically the above steps create an Istio operator controller in the istio-operator namespace and also registers the CRDs in the Kubernetes Registry. Basically, it extends the API for Kubernetes and allows management of a Custom Resource(CR). A word of caution, the existing upstream Istio Operator does not follow any Operator Framework like kubebuilder or Operator SDK. Hence, many of the expected behavior fail like trying to create two Istio Operator Custom Resource(the community mentions it as `iop` instances) in different namespaces or multiple `iop` instances and are under heavy development.\n\nOk, so now lets jump into action. We will build our Istio Setup for the scenario 1 &2 above shown in the diagram below. There are three different instances of Ingress Gateway(and it could be egress gateway as well) :\n\na. Ingress Gateway in Control Plane for traffic entry point to the Control plane Observability Components like `Kiali`(for the Service Mesh Graph), `Prometheus`(for metrics),Grafana(for visual charts of the metrics)and `Jaeger` (for distributed tracing between the services)\nb. Ingress Gateway in the Worskpace 1 namespace for traffic entry point to the workspace 1 microservices.\nc. Ingress Gateway in the Worskpace 2 namespace for traffic entry point to the workspace 2 microservices.\n\n<img src={img1} alt=\"kubernetes-cluster\" />\n<p style={{align: \"center\"}}>\n  Single Control Plane with Multiple Data Plane each with separate Ingress\n  Gateway\n</p>\n\n- Creation of Control Plane CR and Data Plane CR\n  A sample CR for creation of the Control plane and Data Plane CR can be referred below :\n  ```sh\n  $ cat iop-platform.yaml\n  apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1\n  kind: IstioOperator\n  metadata:\n  namespace: istio-system\n  name: platform-istiocontrolplane\n  spec:\n  profile: demo\n  $ cat iop-wk1-gw.yaml\n  apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1\n  kind: IstioOperator\n  metadata:\n  namespace: istio-system\n  name: wk1-gwconfig\n  spec:\n  profile: empty\n  components:\n  ingressGateways:\n  — name: wk1-ingressgw\n  namespace: workspace-1\n  enabled: true\n  label:\n  istio: ingressgateway-1\n  app: istio-ingressgateway-1\n  values:\n  gateways:\n  istio-ingressgateway:\n  debug: error\n  $ cat iop-wk2-gw.yaml\n  apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1\n  kind: IstioOperator\n  metadata:\n  namespace: istio-system\n  name: wk2-gwconfig\n  spec:\n  profile: empty\n  components:\n  ingressGateways:\n  — name: wk2-ingressgw\n  namespace: workspace-2\n  enabled: true\n  label:\n  istio: ingressgateway-2\n  app: istio-ingressgateway-2\n  values:\n  gateways:\n  istio-ingressgateway:\n  debug: error\n  ```\n\nIt is important to make sure the indentation is correct ,otherwise it would lead to errors.\nReference: [Istio Website](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/)\n\nDeploy the CRs using kubectl:\n\n```sh\n$ kubectl create ns istio-system\n$ kubectl create ns workspace-1\n$ kubectl create ns workspace-2\n$ kubectl apply -f ../iop-platform.yaml\nistiooperator.install.istio.io/platform-istiocontrolplane created\n$ kubectl apply -f ../iop-wk1-gw.yaml\nistiooperator.install.istio.io/wk1-gwconfig configured\n$ kubectl apply -f ../iop-wk2-gw.yaml\nistiooperator.install.istio.io/wk2-gwconfig configured\n```\n\n- Troubleshooting the Istio Operator Controller.\n  Its a good idea to run another window and execute the below command to observe the running logs on the controller pod.\n  ```sh\n  $ kubectl logs -f -n istio-operator\n  $(kubectl get pods -n istio-operator -lname=istio-operator -o jsonpath=’{.items[0].metadata.name}’)\n  ```\n\n<img src={img2} alt=\"image\" />\n\n- Observe the created objects in istio-system and the workspace namespaces for all pods to be in running state.\n\n  ```sh\n  $ kubectl get all -n istio-system\n  NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\n  pod/grafana-b54bb57b9-k84xf 1/1 Running 0 79s\n  pod/istio-egressgateway-77c7d594c5-fr79j 1/1 Running 0 83s\n  pod/istio-ingressgateway-766c84dfdc-p6g6t 1/1 Running 0 83s\n  pod/istio-tracing-9dd6c4f7c-ndjvn 1/1 Running 0 79s\n  pod/istiod-7b69ff6f8c-9gwp8 1/1 Running 0 94s\n  pod/kiali-d45468dc4–4sww2 1/1 Running 0 79s\n  pod/prometheus-5fdfc44fb7–67khx 2/2 Running 0 78s\n  <truncated>\n  esudbat@istio:~/istio$ kubectl get all -n workspace-1\n  NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE\n  pod/wk1-ingressgw-5674488c8b-fg2w5 1/1 Running 0 21s\n  <truncated>\n  esudbat@istio:~/istio$ kubectl get all -n workspace-2\n  ```\n\n- Now we will label the namespaces for istio-injection\n\n  ```sh\n  $kubectl label namespace workspace-1 istio-injection=enabled\n  $kubectl label namespace workspace-2 istio-injection=enabled\n  ```\n\n- Now we will deploy the bookinfo sample application in both namespaces but before that we need to make sure that the Gateway resource is updated with the correct label selector as below :\n\n  ```sh\n  $ cat istio/bookinfo-gateway-1.yaml\n  apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3\n  kind: Gateway\n  metadata:\n  name: bookinfo-gateway\n  spec:\n  selector:\n  istio: ingressgateway-1 # use istio gateway-1 controller in workspace-1\n  servers:\n  — port:\n  number: 80\n  name: http\n  protocol: HTTP\n  hosts:\n  — “*”\n  $ cat istio/bookinfo-gateway-2.yaml\n  apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3\n  kind: Gateway\n  metadata:\n  name: bookinfo-gateway\n  spec:\n  selector:\n  istio: ingressgateway-2 # use istio gateway-2 controller in workspace-1\n  servers:\n  — port:\n  number: 80\n  name: http\n  protocol: HTTP\n  hosts:\n  — “*”\n  ```\n\nDeploy the applications in workspace-1 and workspace-2 and deploy the Gateway,VirtualService and DestinationRules.\n\n```sh\n$kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml -n workspace-1\n$kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/platform/kube/bookinfo.yaml -n workspace-2\n$kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml -n workspace-1\n$kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/bookinfo-gateway.yaml -n workspace-2\n$kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml -n workspace-1\n$kubectl apply -f samples/bookinfo/networking/destination-rule-all-mtls.yaml -n workspace-2\n```\n\nEssentially what is happening is the Gateway CR is configuring the traffic to come via the ingress-gateway, it specifies the label selector based on which the ingress-gateway is selected and the host from where the traffic is allowed and port on which the traffic is allowed. It is important to ensure the label maps the label on the ingress-gateway.\nOnce this is done the traffic will start flowing the intended gateway and it could be observed on the Kiali dashboard.\nPlease note that in this scenario the Kiali is also accessed via the default control plane ingress-gateway running in the istio-system control plane namespace.\n\n<img src={img3} alt=\"image\" />\n<p style={{align: \"center\"}}>Kiali view for Workspace-1</p>\n\n<img src={img4} alt=\"image\" />\n<p style={{align: \"center\"}}>Kiali view for Workspace-2</p>\n\nShortly, we will go over the 3rd scenario which is to run multiple Istio Control Planes (Multiple Service Meshes) within the same Kubernetes Cluster. For that, we will need to build an open-shift setup and deploy the Maistra Istio Operator.\nSpecial thanks to the [Istio Community](https://istio.slack.com/) for helping me understand the concepts and also answering my queries and of course to [Lee Calcote](https://calcotestudios.com/talks/), who helped me embark on my Istio journey.\n\n<div>\n  <b>\n    Connect with Sudeep Batra on\n    <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sudeep-batra\"> LinkedIn</a>,<a href=\"https://github.com/sb1975\">\n      {\" \"}GitHub</a>, or\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sudeepbatra\"> Twitter</a>.\n  </b>\n</div>\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Service Mesh (Istio) patterns for Multitenancy","date":"Jul 18th, 2020","author":"Sudeep Batra","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkYAAABXRUJQVlA4IDoAAAAwAwCdASoUAA0APtFUpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJaQAAetGLLsAAAP7vhDiT/XpMBU3mvncWVJalRVYSIAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/d65dc/image2.webp","srcSet":"/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/1f1d0/image2.webp 750w,\n/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/d65dc/image2.webp 1050w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.638095238095238}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/image2.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkYAAABXRUJQVlA4IDoAAAAwAwCdASoUAA0APtFUpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJaQAAetGLLsAAAP7vhDiT/XpMBU3mvncWVJalRVYSIAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/d65dc/image2.webp","srcSet":"/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/1f1d0/image2.webp 750w,\n/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/d65dc/image2.webp 1050w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.638095238095238}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/6126014dd6a4c684993008406f28dae0/image2.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/istio/service-mesh-istio-patterns-for-multitenancy"}},{"id":"84298721-6095-5aac-89d3-02e19185dfe3","body":"\n\nimport pic1 from \"./pic1.webp\";\nimport pic2 from \"./pic2.jpeg\";\nimport pic3 from \"./pic3.webp\";\nimport pic4 from \"./pic4.webp\";\nimport pic5 from \"./pic5.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\nIt all started 9 months ago when I stumbled across the following LinkedIn post, written by a college senior who had recently scored an internship with Redhat.\n\n<img src={pic3} alt=\"book\"/>\n\nThis led me to a long-winding conversation with Subham Kumar Rai and Anand Kumar Singh about Layer5 and how amazing an opportunity it would be to be a part of this emerging community. I did some research on service meshes and made my way to the Layer5 Github repo. From there, it was a swift journey to the Layer5 Slack Channel where I truly understood what Subham had meant about the warm welcome. I was amazed by how helpful and willing the entire community was. Armed with the resources I needed, I delved into the projects and churned out a few PRs and I was hooked. I dove aggressively into the projects and handled any curve balls with the help of my mentors. My participation in the Layer5 community drove me to a well earned obsession with open source projects which led me to make my own contributions in the FOSSASIA and GATSBY projects and take part in many open-source contests such as Hacktoberfest, DevopsCember, Kharagpur Winter Of Code (KWOC), NJACK Winter Of Code (NWOC), Girlscript Summer Of Code (GSSOC).\n\n<img src={pic4} alt=\"github-profile\"/>\n\n#### What is Meshery?\n\nMeshery is a multi-service mesh management plane that offers lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of service meshes and applications running on top of those meshes.<br/>\n\n<img src={pic1} alt=\"meshry\"/>\n\nMeshery uses a common service mesh performance specification to describe and capture performance benchmarks and results. The spec contains general information about the performance test (e.g. start/end times), service mesh and proxy build numbers, Kubernetes cluster details (nodes, type of nodes, memory information), and the actual results. One of the ideas behind Meshery is to be a vendor and project-neutral tool that can benchmark the performance of different service meshes. <br/>\nIt is a one stop for all your service meshing needs. Service meshes are still a novel concept for both, developers and users. Meshery steps in to bridge this gap and allows you to have a better understanding of what a service mesh can provide by helping you judge service mesh for your personal and professional needs. Meshery accomplishes this by providing you a thorough analysis of the options available so that you can make an informed choice.<br/>\n\n<img className=\"alignRight\" src={pic2} alt=\"Lee Calcote\" />\n\n#### Lee Calcote\n\nLee Calcote is an innovative leader and has previously made waves in the tech community as a Docker Captain and a Cloud Native Ambassador and that is just a milestone in his impressive journey, which consists of his admirable work with developer platforms, cloud technology, containers, functions, and applications. Advanced and emerging technologies have been a consistent focus through Calcote’s tenure at SolarWinds, Seagate, Cisco, and Pelco. In my tenure at Layer5, Lee has been an amazing mentor, someone you can always look towards for encouragement, inspiration and a kind word, especially when you’re melting under the heat to make that late night deadline.\n\n\n#### Layer5 and UEM Jaipur Partnership Program\nIn an effort to foster the open source community in my college, I along with four of my batchmates (Anand, Subham, Nikhil, Gunjan) decided to start an open source partnership program, encouraged by Lee and Rupayan Das (Faculty, UEM Jaipur). This will hopefully lead to making future batches more aware about the essence of open source and encourage them to participate in communities like Layer5.\n\n<img src={pic5} alt=\"layer5\"/>\n\n#### Community Love\n\nThe Layer5 community has welcomed me with patience and has given me a sense of purpose, which is more than I could have asked for at the beginning as a novice developer. The warm welcome and a sincere string of mentors can do wonders in building your confidence and enabling you to put in your best foot forward. Open source has introduced me to a horde of essential qualities, such as the importance of teamwork, candor and earnestness. <br/>\nIt has been a prodigious journey so far and I don’t intend to stop here. The pace at which the projects under the Layer5 community are unwinding is awe-inspiring. It is my aim to be a witness and a partner in crime in its future endeavors.

The Community Bridge Mentorship is a structured remote learning opportunity for aspiring open source software developers. The projects they host are mentored by experienced open source project developers and maintainers.\n\n<h4> Stumbling into Service Mesh Interface (SMI) </h4>\n\nI began working on SMI Conformance testing under the guidance of Lee Calcote, Founder of Layer5, in February 2020. Since then, my path into the world of service meshes has brought me an avalanche of opportunities and has helped me grow by leaps and bounds as a developer.\nThe Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a standard interface that encapsulates various common service mesh functionalities. It explains several Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), their configuration variables, and their corresponding effect on the service mesh underneath in full detail. What makes SMI vital is that these CRDs are generic, and the specifications are implemented and actively followed up by various service meshes. Some of these service meshes have developed adapters that define SMI CRDs as a wrapper over the APIs they already provide, instead of adhering to the SMI spec internally. SMI specifications address essential features for the most common service mesh use cases:\n\n<img className=\"image-right\" src={smiLogo} alt=\"smi-logo\"/>\n\n- Traffic policy – To apply policies like identity and transport encryption across services\n- Traffic telemetry – To capture key metrics like error rate and latency between services\n- Traffic management – To shift traffic between different services\n\nHowever, at the moment, no service meshes adhere to the SMI specifications completely. Service meshes are rapidly developing and making active efforts to extend their feature set. Simultaneously, SMI has also been working towards adding more features to its specifications.\n\nConsequently, it becomes a necessity for continual validation of service mesh conformance with respect to SMI specifications and  the various versions of those specifications. The process of verifying conformance needs to be standardized and tooling made available.  Hence, our project efforts to create an SMI conformance tool.\n\n<h4> Meshery to the Rescue </h4>\n\nMeshery is the multi-service mesh management plane, offering lifecycle, configuration, and performance management of service meshes and their workloads. It is closely connected to the Kubernetes cluster and allows easy deployment of various service meshes and sample applications onto those meshes. Meshery enables operators to run performance tests on workloads, collect, store, and manage the test results.\n\n\nWe had found our solution. By leveraging the features provided in Meshery, we would be able to focus on the conformance validation and testing instead of sweating over the complexity in deployments. We can also use the performance management infrastructure to manage the conformance tests and their results. And so,  the tool will be developed as an integral part of Meshery to aid and abate SMI conformance woes.\nWe are now enhancing Meshery to automate the process of verifying conformance against a standard set of tests against a sample workload designed specifically for SMI conformance testing. By the time we’re through, this capability of Meshery will allow each service mesh project to validate its conformance to each version of the SMI specifications and will provide a detailed report.\n\n<h4> My Projects </h4>\n\nThe goals accomplished in my tenure at Layer5 are summarized as follows:\n\n1. **[Meshery Providers](https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility)** - Ported Meshery and its remote provider from using session based authentication to JWT based auth. This opened doors to:\n    - Usage of refresh tokens for longevity of sessions instead of asking user to re-login frequently.\n    - CLI based authentication (not done yet, but is on the roadmap)\n2. **[Image Hub](https://github.com/layer5io/image-hub)** - WASM based envoy network packet filters in Rust-lang. Built a demo app demonstrating its potentials; we also built a  WASM filter which performs custom user specific rate limiting. This app was demo’ed in Dockercon 2020 under the header “Service Meshing with Docker Desktop and WebAssembly”.\n3. **[Implementing the Service Mesh Performance Specification](/projects/service-mesh-performance)** - Enhanced Meshery’s performance testing and profile management capabilities. Added support for customizing the requests made by the load generator, and added the capability of using performance test profiles in the tool.\n\nYou can find my code in the [**Learn Layer5 repository**](https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5/).\n\n<h4> Love for the Community </h4>\n\nI have been actively involved in the Layer5 community for a number of months now and am proud of the contributions I have made to various projects under the Layer5 banner. The Layer5 community represents an eclectic mix of geeky developers, out of the box thinkers, sassy writers and some of the most amazing people I have met so far in the open source community.  We build projects to provide learning environments, deployment, and operational best practices, performance benchmarks, create documentation, and more. I am truly ecstatic to be a part of such an enthusiastic and welcoming community.<br/>\n\nAs you’ve made it to the end of my post, why not stick around and take a look at the amazing projects I just described? You might just find your dream project and if not, I can promise that you will at least end up becoming a part of one of the best open source communities out there.<br/>\nTo stay tuned with the progress of the project, please join us in the [Slack](http://slack.layer5.io) channel!\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"CommunityBridge 2020: Teaching service meshes to be compliant","date":"Jul 16th, 2020","author":"Kanishkar J","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmYAAABXRUJQVlA4IFoAAADwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCw7BksTDwAsI06Wb4AAP6lPu4+GUO9LUK40huBreExJQysd66iB+wS5gcYOfOyhhNafXGCDhujCR/Ywo9AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/31cc3/communitybridge.webp","srcSet":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/7513b/communitybridge.webp 750w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/317ed/communitybridge.webp 1080w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/31cc3/communitybridge.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5233333333333333}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/communitybridge.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmYAAABXRUJQVlA4IFoAAADwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCw7BksTDwAsI06Wb4AAP6lPu4+GUO9LUK40huBreExJQysd66iB+wS5gcYOfOyhhNafXGCDhujCR/Ywo9AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/31cc3/communitybridge.webp","srcSet":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/7513b/communitybridge.webp 750w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/317ed/communitybridge.webp 1080w,\n/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/31cc3/communitybridge.webp 1200w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5233333333333333}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4ca9357bcd4f83cb408c28072a14e52d/communitybridge.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/communitybridge-2020-teaching-service-meshes-to-be-compliant"}},{"id":"8e28ec79-117e-5c1c-a35f-e6716f1adde9","body":"\n\nimport IshitaProfile from \"./ishita-kumar-profile.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img className=\"image-left\" src={IshitaProfile} alt=\"Ishita Kumar Profile\"/>\n\nAs a graduate student at the Indiana University Bloomington, studying for my Masters in Computer Science, little did I consider that my thesis project would lead me on this amazing journey to becoming an open source contributor.\n\nMy adventure with Layer5 has been a highly informative and invigorating experience, from coming aboard as a Meshery user to becoming an open source contributor. My initial interest in Layer5 was sparked when, for a project in my Masters course, I was required to build a microservice architecture and develop a service layer on top of it.\nA basic Google search led me to a plethora of resources, which in turn led me to understand how different service meshes could be compared. Comparison and selection of a service mesh was my first step to deploying one on my VM cluster. Amidst the varied resources available to me, stumbling onto Layer5 and Meshery was a happy boon.\n\n## Why Meshery?\n\nFrom the beginning, Meshery proved to be an intuitive and easy-to-use application. Among other benefits, it could be implemented into my project with ease which was also a major contributing factor behind my choice of taking advantage of its features for my project thesis.\nThere are tons of resources online that compare different service meshes for your deployment however meshery was the only project that actually offered a practical way of comparing service meshes. In just a few easy steps, I could download and deploy  Meshery into my VM instance and compare the performance of my microservice application running atop two different service meshes:  Istio and Linkerd, thereby gathering various statistics on how they worked on my application.\n\nWhat really got my hooked though was Meshery's intuitive UI and the amazing open platform support, which made me strive to rise above and beyond my project goals, to truly understand and value the underlying idea.\n\n## Insights While Meshing Around\n\nWhile using Meshery to deploy both Istio and Linkerd, I came to the understanding that while Meshery uses common methods for interfacing with and managing service meshes, that Meshery is also capable of exposing service mesh-specific features. This became apparent by how robust Meshery’s adapter for Istio is, which includes the ability to analyze and validate my deployment’s configuration against best practices. Each adapter includes a set of sample applications that makes it convenient to explore the functionality of different meshes, using the same application across them.\n\nThe behavior that was of keen interest to me, however, was that of my custom, microservices. When deploying my microservices application, Meshery helped me understand how different service meshes were interacting with my software application.\n\nI learned that in addition to the easy integration of Meshery in my application, it also provides one of the best platforms out there to manage service meshes and gives you a fair assessment of your deployment, which can otherwise prove to be a daunting task.\n\nWhile presenting my findings to my class and professor, they were able to gauge the brilliancy each service mesh would bring into the microservice application.\n\n## Shout out to the Community\n\nThe Layer5 community has proved to be incredibly helpful in my journey. Communicating mainly through Slack channels, the community is vibrant and very welcoming. Any integration issues that arose for me were quickly and efficiently solved. <br />\nI am thankful that my experiences as a user, as well as a contributor, has allowed me to be a valued part of this wholesome group. Layer5 has truly made me understand the significance of an open source \"community\" and I’ll admit - I’m hooked. The number and variety of novel projects that are pushing the envelope of emerging technology within this community is enthralling. <br/>\nI’m here for the long-haul, so expect to hear from me again as I wrap my arms around these projects. If the suite of Layer5 projects interests you, please [join the community](http://slack.layer5.io)!  <br />\nThen, drop me a line as I work toward becoming a [MeshMate](https://layer5.io/community/meshmates).\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"My Meshy Journey","date":"Jul 3rd, 2020","author":"Ishita Kumar","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqQAAABXRUJQVlA4IJgAAABwBACdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJagCdMoADf9+vb/n770gWvzDSAAD+9g5vn2hVRY3uf6DryxMu4TyY5S4FyHUBUq41Qes3bA0Ha/pi/sJgFqvukiF1UaB78Od+L1vyMWnSZNIjZjPEIjQhuyV/hiJM4ZglhGbMTG4vO6PsMFVqFj+azHDVfnB53wSaZVy33QAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ba985/ishita-kumar.webp","srcSet":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ba985/ishita-kumar.webp 666w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5870870870870871}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ishita-kumar.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqQAAABXRUJQVlA4IJgAAABwBACdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJagCdMoADf9+vb/n770gWvzDSAAD+9g5vn2hVRY3uf6DryxMu4TyY5S4FyHUBUq41Qes3bA0Ha/pi/sJgFqvukiF1UaB78Od+L1vyMWnSZNIjZjPEIjQhuyV/hiJM4ZglhGbMTG4vO6PsMFVqFj+azHDVfnB53wSaZVy33QAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ba985/ishita-kumar.webp","srcSet":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ba985/ishita-kumar.webp 666w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5870870870870871}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b6d13cc3206567231456339006323d02/ishita-kumar.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/community/my-meshy-journey"}},{"id":"933fdd2b-b2a4-5371-bb9a-f047b72e3e23","body":"\n\nimport smilogo from \"./smi-logo.webp\";\nimport checklist from \"./checklist.svg\"\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img src={smilogo} align=\"right\" alt=\"smilogo\" width=\"200px\" style={{margin: \"1rem 2rem\"}} />\n\n### About SMI\n\nThe Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a specification for service meshes that run on Kubernetes. It utilizes CRDs to modify the behavior of service meshes. The project is under development at [SMI Github Repository](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec). Please visit the github repository page to know the latest advancements in the characteristics. The complete spec can be found [here](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md).\n\n### APIs in SMI\n\nCurrently SMI supports 4 set of APIs:\n\n- [Traffic Specs](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-specs) - Used to define traffic, currently only supports TCP, HTTP traffic.\n- [Traffic Access Control](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-access-control) - Used to specify whether a particular form of traffic is allowed or not\n- [Traffic Split](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-split) - Used to redirect/divide a request for a resource between 2 or more resources. Useful in canary testing\n- [Traffic Metrics](https://github.com/servicemeshinterface/smi-spec/blob/master/SPEC.md#traffic-metrics) - Used to expose common traffic metrics like p99 in a specific format that can be utilized by single dashboard for all the service meshes.\n\n### About SMI Conformance Tests\n\n**SMI Conformance Tests** check whether the service mesh that is installed in the kubernetes cluster, conforms to SMI specs or not. This involves asking some major questions. Does it have the required CRDs? Do these CRDs perform as they should when applied or not applied? Are we able to get metrics in a proper format?\n\nAll these questions will be answered by SMI conformance tests. The biggest benefit of your service mesh conforming to SMI is that it makes building tools an easier process.Also, one time development of any tool would in turn support all the meshes that conform to SMI.\n\nSounds fun, right? Let's dig deeper into the SMI conformance project and find out.\n\n### Meshery'ing with Conformance Tests\n\n<img src={checklist} align=\"left\" alt=\"checklist\" width=\"250px\"/>\n\n<Link to=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\">Meshery</Link>  is _the cloud native management plane__. It supports all the popular meshes, teaches you how to manage them, assists you in applying custom or recommended configurations, tests for  compatibility, performs performance tests for meshes and a lot more. The SMI conformance testing requires performance testing capabilities, load generation (Meshery is about to support distributed load generation as well), and other functionalities such that these conformance tests can be easily used in the pipelines of all the popular service meshes. mesheryctl does have a perf command that can be used in the pipelines of service meshes. I aim at making such capabilities for SMI conformance as well.\n\nAs you have made your way halfway through the post (thank you for your patience), you should now be aware of SMI, its conformance practices and how Meshery’s incredible engineering can be utilized for conformance tests. We can now tackle the larger questions and hope to see the bigger picture.\n\n### The Bigger Picture\n\nDo you know that almost all of the test cases that we would write in this project would be  raw YAML files? To those doing traditional unit and integration tests, we might sound unhinged at this point. We assure you that we are completely sober and serious (if you don’t count the temporary euphoria from geeky jokes).\n\n#### Forking [kuttl](https://kuttl.dev/)\n\n`kuttl` is a tool for writing tests against Kubernetes operators and controllers. It can ascertain whether any kind of resources exist or not in the Kubernetes cluster, spring up a kind cluster and do other convenient things. Another plus is that It's entirely declarative. Consider a scenario in which we have a special use case where we wanted to run some go code  after each individual step in the test case was executed. To accomplish this, we forked `kuttl` and modified it a little. You can see our modified version [here](https://github.com/kanishkarj/kuttl).\n\n\nWe are planning to use `kuttl` for all the APIs in SMI. We are also planning to use the Meshery load generator with the modified version of `kuttl`.\n\n#### [Learn Layer5](https://github.com/layer5io/learn-layer5/)\n\nLearn Layer5 is a sample app which is very lightweight and simple to deploy. It is a simple sample app for learning about service meshes. We are planning to use the same app for testing for SMI conformance. The app is deployed when we test for SMI conformance and traffic is generated from one service/deployment/pod to another. This is a great tool for playing around with service meshes and the tools provided by Layer5 and its projects without investing any personal resources.\n\nThis is where all the test cases along with the code will be placed. Currently, there is a large overlap in the learn-layer5 and `smi-conformance` testing files. All those changes will be transferred here.\n\nIf any of this sounds remotely exciting, I implore you to give this a chance. You won’t regret it.\nHead over to our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and join the #smi channel where everything related to conformance testing is discussed. We would love to hear your feedback. Stay tuned for more blogs related to SMI Conformance and all things meshy!!!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Starting SMI Conformance Testing with Meshery","date":"Jun 25th, 2020","author":"Naveen Kumar","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/d0daea53e35a8641bb6bf51dfd650543/smi-conformance.svg"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/d0daea53e35a8641bb6bf51dfd650543/smi-conformance.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/starting-smi-conformance-testing-with-meshery"}},{"id":"32283426-1a74-5e55-bb59-58d77844180c","body":"\n\nimport gsocLogo from \"./gsoc.webp\";\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<h4>How did it all start?</h4>\n<img src={gsocLogo} className=\"gsoc-image\" align=\"right\" alt=\"gsoc-image\" />\n<p>\nI was introduced to the Layer5 community by our very own Lee Calcote, and since then I have been exploring the vast world of service meshes and their performance characteristics. Before being accepted as a Google Summer of Code intern, I had been working with the Layer5 community as an active contributor, exploring various new DevOps tooling like service meshes, the sidecar concept, and performance benchmarking of services. I have had a run-in with the Kubernetes community before and initially believed Kubernetes to be the final stage of DevOps, but I was happily surprised when I found out that the end of Kubernetes merely marked the entrypoint to a whole new world of service meshes.\n</p>\n<p>\nAnd so, we reach the beginning of my GSoC 2020 internship, which began on the night of May 3rd, 2020 when I learned that I had been selected as a GSoC Participant with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Admittedly, I had tried my best an year ago to get into GSoC’19 with another organisation but due to reasons only Google can tell you, I was not accepted. Everything happens for a reason though, right?\nSix months ago, if you would have told me that I would be working with service meshes, gRPC, load testing, performance benchmarking alongside prominent members of the open source world of Cloud Native, I would have ignored you with the least possible amount of prudence I could muster.\n</p>\n\n<h4>What is my project about?</h4>\n<p>\nMy GSoC project is to <strong>Enable Distributed Load Testing for various Service Mesh Planes using Envoy Nighthawk</strong>. For those who are not familiar with <a href=\"https://github.com/envoyproxy/nighthawk\">Nighthawk</a>, it is a performance benchmark tool written and maintained by the Envoy community. We are in the process of incorporating Nighthawk into <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> - <i>the cloud native management plane</i>.Meshery already supports performance testing of service meshes using fortio & wrk2 and is maintained by the Layer5 community and is also a member of CNCF Landscape. Alongside this effort, we are creating a new industry standard: <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">Service Mesh Performance Specification</Link> which is another initiative of the Layer5 community to establish a common format for describing and capturing service mesh performance.\n</p>\n<p>\nIt has  been a month since I have started my GSoC’20 tenure with the Layer5 community, and in this month, I have learned a lot from my code contributions and mentor. I began with setting up the project roadmap and discussing the potential use cases of Nighthawk with its maintainers during my community bonding period. I came to know some incredible people during the community bonding from big tech giants like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Affirmed Networks, Red Hat and many more to list. Before incorporating Nighthawk, we had to make various enhancements in Meshery, like adding user preferences for performance settings, specifying the SMPS format for exporting and importing of load-test preferences, load-generator interface and more.\n</p>\n<p>\nI have learned a hoard of new things, like gRPC services and how they communicate using protocol buffers, load generation using fortio, writing handlers for various endpoints using golang, and some frontend architecture with Nextjs.\n</p>\n\n\n<h4>About the community</h4>\n<p>\nLayer5 has one of the healthiest open source communities that I have ever worked with. In the past, I have worked with a variety of well-maintained and large scale open source communities but I have never experienced a more welcoming and nurturing environment than Layer5. At Layer5, we respect each contributor and their contributions, whether it is a new adapter or just a typo fix. If you can contribute, please do. It’s that simple! With many awesome initiatives like SMPS, Distributed Load Testing, Performance Benchmarking, Learn Layer5, and Image Hub, the exponential increase of Layer5 and its various projects is inevitable.\n</p>\n\n\n_**P.S.: If these topics excite you and you want to explore the beautiful realm of service meshes, come and say \"Hi\" on our [Slack Channel](http://slack.layer5.io) and one of us will reach out to you!**_\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Summer of Code 2020: Service Mesh Performance with Envoy Nighthawk","date":"Jun 23rd, 2020","author":"Kush Trivedi","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAACQAwCdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBkTBDeFw39gZx3QAP72Cc70c8ZoK8QqR+k7m52LH+/nTu8WyQT8aGXHEL8AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp","srcSet":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/a83d3/gsoc-wide.webp 750w,\n/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.59375}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/gsoc-wide.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAACQAwCdASoUAAwAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBkTBDeFw39gZx3QAP72Cc70c8ZoK8QqR+k7m52LH+/nTu8WyQT8aGXHEL8AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp","srcSet":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/a83d3/gsoc-wide.webp 750w,\n/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/51bba/gsoc-wide.webp 800w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.59375}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/91b648eb8db7b8bfdc0ee72d376e029b/gsoc-wide.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/programs/google-summer-of-code-2020-service-mesh-performance-with-envoy-nighthawk"}},{"id":"fbdb0105-a11c-58b8-b99e-f59449dd09f9","body":"\n\nimport cncf from \"./cncf-landscape-stacked-color.svg\"\nimport cncfmeshery from \"./cncf-meshery-landscape.webp\"\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img src={cncf} className=\"image-right\" alt=\"cncf-landscape-stacked-color\" />\n\n### Digging into Service Meshes\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I got interested in service mesh technology. A customer needed some advanced routing capabilities and we started looking at Envoy and Istio. Then - invitations to talk about Istio at meetups and conferences started flowing in. That's when I got excited about progressive delivery capabilities that service meshes enable. I even wrote a Kubernetes Istio canary controller - BirdWatch.\n\n### Finding Meshery\n\nDigging deeper into what service meshes had to offer I discovered Meshery - the universal service mesh management plane. And immediately joined Layer5 - the great, welcoming open-source community that created it.\n\n### Community Matters\n\nBeing a member of Layer5 was one of the nicest community experiences I've ever had. Mainly thanks to community's founder and captain - Lee Calcote. He always makes sure everybody feels significant, included and motivated to participate. And this spirit spreads out to all community activities.\n\nIn no time, I had my first commits approved and merged and started joining weekly community and development video calls.\n\n### We're on CNCF Landscape!\n\nNow - I won't be reviewing Meshery in this post. I've spoken about it in this video and some great introductory articles by community members can be found here and here. This post is more of a celebration, because last week...\n\n<h5 style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}><i>Meshery now featured in the CNCF Landscape!</i></h5>\n\n<img src={cncfmeshery} className=\"image-center\" alt=\"cncf-meshery-landscape\" />\n\nAnd this is only the first step - there's already an application filed for Meshery to become a full-fledged CNCF sandbox project. I had a chance to collaborate on the sandbox proposal and am so eager for this to happen.\n\n### Getting Meshy\n\nThis is also an invitation to participate - Meshery is a young, ambitious project - it requires a ton of work to make it what it aims to become. Integrating with all of the leading service mesh solutions asks for extensive expertise. In many areas Meshery's functionality is still young. But these are normal growth stages, aren't they? To put it simple - the community and the project need more hands! And these should be your hands!\n\n<p style={{textAlign: \"center\"}}><i>As already mentioned - Layer5 is a very welcoming bunch!</i></p>\n\nOpen source contributions are a must-do for becoming a true cloud native hero. Cloud native is all about the community and one can't be a part of a community by only taking and never giving back. So if you were looking for a promising and welcoming project to join - look no further! Hop on to Layer5 Slack and we'll happily embrace you and help you get started.\n\nAnd it's not only coding! Documentation, testing, UI design, logos, blogs, videos - you decide where to apply your talent.\n\nFor example - I sometimes wish I had more time and motivation to code new Meshery features or fix existing bugs. But instead I'm writing this post. Because lately I enjoy writing texts more than coding. Coding for longer than a couple of days at a time throws me into a coding fatigue… Actually also many other activities do. I'm just not very good at keeping a routine. But I'm sure many of you out there aren't like me.

Meshery is created by the <Link to=\"/community\">Layer5</Link>.\n\nLayer5 is a community-first, service mesh company which has technology <Link to=\"/partners\">partnerships</Link> with various tech giants like Microsoft, HashiCorp, CNCF, RedHat and many more to enlist. The community consists of open source leaders like maintainers of trending open-source projects, Google SoCers, Docker Captains, service mesh maintainers, Cloud Native Ambassadors and many more (<a href=\"http://slack.layer5.io\">join in!</a>).\n\n\n### What is mesheryctl?\n\nMeshery provides you with a clean, robust, streamlined command-line interface to manage and benchmark your service meshes, `mesheryctl`. With `mesheryctl`, not only you can manage your adapters & containers but you can also benchmark your mesh using the command line. `mesheryctl` provides support to a number of platforms so that we never miss out users. `mesheryctl` can be installed with a single bash command by simply executing:\n\n```bash\n$ curl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n````\n\nin your terminal. You will see Meshery getting installed & fired up on port: 9081.\nYou will see the output as\n\n\n```\nExtracting mesheryctl-v0.3.14...\nArchive:  /Users/user/meshery.zip\n  inflating: LICENSE\n  inflating: README.md\n  inflating: mesheryctl\n\nInstalling mesheryctl in /usr/local/bin.\nmesheryctl installed.\npermissions moved to user\nRemoving installation files and opening Meshery...Updating Meshery now...\nPulling meshery          ... download complete\nPulling meshery-istio    ... done\nPulling meshery-linkerd  ... done\nPulling meshery-consul   ... done\nPulling meshery-octarine ... done\nPulling meshery-nsm      ... done\nPulling meshery-cpx      ... done\nPulling watchtower       ... done\n```\n\nand you will be able to see the Meshery UI on `https://localhost:9081`.\n\nIf you are wondering if bash is only way to get `mesheryctl`, then here is the list of platforms which you can get `mesheryctl describing all the different ways to get it.\n\n<table className=\"table-1\" align=\"center\">\n<thead>\n    <tr>\n    <th align=\"left\">Platform</th>\n    <th >Supported?</th>\n    </tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <td ><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/docker\">Docker</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/docker\">Docker - Docker App</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/kubernetes\">Kubernetes</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/aks\">Kubernetes - AKS</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Kubernetes - Docker Desktop</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/eks\">Kubernetes - EKS</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/gke\">Kubernetes - GKE</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/kubernetes#helm\">Kubernetes - Helm</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/minikube\">Kubernetes - Minikube</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - Kubernetes - OpenShift</td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">In Progress</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Linux</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/quick-start\">Mac</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl#homebrew\">Mac - Homebrew</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td><a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/windows\">Windows</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/mesheryctl#scoop\">Scoop</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td> - <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/installation/platforms/windows#wsl\">WSL2</a></td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">✔️</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n    <td>Raspberry Pi</td>\n    <td className=\"text-centre\">In Progress</td>\n    </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n<br/>\nWe believe we have not missed any of the popular platforms for what it’s worth, we will be rolling out support for RaspberryPi and OpenShift soon 🎉🎉🎉.\n\nIf you are thinking about the requirements you would have to run `mesheryctl`, so to your surprise, to successfully run `mesheryctl` you will only need :\n\n<table align=\"center\" className=\"table-box\"><tbody><tr><td className=\"text-centre\">a running Docker daemon</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\n### Into the MesheryCTL\n\nOnce you have successfully installed, you will be having the power of a new CLI Command MesheryCTL. As you type `mesheryctl` into your terminal, you will be shown with the various sub-commands and flags `mesheryctl` can support.\n\n```\nMeshery is the cloud native management plane, providing lifecycle, performance, and configuration management of service meshes and their workloads.\n\nUsage:\n  mesheryctl [command]\n\nAvailable Commands:\n  help        Help about any command\n  perf        Performance Management\n  system      Meshery Lifecyle Management\n  version     Print mesheryctl version\n\n\nFlags:\n      --config string    config file (default location is: $HOME/.meshery//meshery.yaml)\n  -h, --help            help for mesheryctl\n  -v, --version         Version of mesheryctl\n\nUse \"mesheryctl [command] --help\" for more information about a command.\n```\n\nOnce you do `mesheryctl system start`, Meshery will pull its adapters and latest docker images. Meshery will also detect your Kubernetes configuration and will let you know if Kubernetes is running. Meshery will run it’s web-based user interface on localhost port `9081` and will let you select your choice of <a href=\"https://docs.meshery.io/extensibility#providers\">Provider</a> before you can start managing your service meshes with this powerful utility.\n\n<table align=\"center\" className=\"table-box\"><tbody><tr><td className=\"text-centre\">One of the most interesting sub-commands of <code>mesheryctl</code> is <strong><code>perf</code></strong>.</td></tr></tbody></table>\n\nThe `perf` subcommand enables you to being managing the performance of your service mesh deployment and your workloads running atop of them. It lets you benchmark your service mesh without using the Meshery UI from the command line interface itself. Once you type `mesheryctl perf`, it will present you with all the powerful flags you can control with CLI, including providing it with a `--file` flag that points to any of a number of performance test profiles that you may have saved.\n\n```\nPerformance Management and Benchmarking using Meshery CLI.\n\nUsage:\n  mesheryctl perf --[flags]\n\nAvailable Flags for Performance Command:\n  name[string]                  (optional) A short descriptor to serve as reference for this test. If not provided, a random name will be generate.\n  url[string]                   (required) URL endpoint to send requests.\n  duration[string]              (required) Length of time to perform test (e.g 30s, 15m, 1hr). See standard notation https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration\n  load-generator[string]        (optional) Name of load generator to be used to perform test (default: \"fortio\")\n  mesh[string]                  (optional) Name of the service mesh to be tested (default: \"None\")\n  provider[string]              (required) Choice of Provider (default: \"Meshery\")\n  concurrent-requests[string]   (optional) Number of parallel requests to be sent (default: \"1\")\n  qps[string]                   (required) Queries per second (default: \"0\")\n  file[string]                  (optional) file containing SMPS-compatible test configuration. See https://github.com/layer5io/service-mesh-performance-specification\n  help                          Help for perf subcommand\n\nurl, duration, concurrent-requests, and qps can be considered optional flags if specified through an SMPS compatible yaml file using --file\n```\n\nAn example usage of `mesheryctl perf --[flags]` can be\n\n```bash\n mesheryctl perf --name \"a quick stress test\" --url http://192.168.1.15/productpage --qps 300 --concurrent-requests 2 --duration 30s --token \"provider=Meshery\"\n```\n\nYou can also provide a SMPS Configuration file with `perf` subcommand, with this file provided you will not have to specify url, duration, concurrent-requests & qps. However, if specified the value provided through file will be over-rided by value through CLI. For more info about file configuration, see [here](https://github.com/service-mesh-performance/service-mesh-performance/blob/master/docs/assets/spec/readme/service%20mesh%20performance%20specification%20result.yaml).\n\n```bash\n mesheryctl perf --name \"a quick stress test\" --file {path}/smps.yaml --token \"provider=Meshery\"\n```\n\n### What's next?\n\nMeshery is an ever-growing community with attracting contributors from across the globe.

Meshery already supports a number of leading mesh providers with adapters for additional meshes on the way. In today’s video, I’ll show how to use Meshery for rolling out and evaluating Linkerd.\n\n Linkerd is a system that comes from the service mesh pioneers - the company called Buoyant.

Shortly before writing my last post, I did open [one such pull request (layer5#238)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238). However, since my PR remains open, and since I am still working on the same issue my PR addresses, I have opted to instead push [a new commit](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/commits/4d396aaa6d3ca46add71531daedc8c0e2a5d2495) to the aformentioned (but, now, renamed) PR instead of creating a whole new one. This newest commit introduces a major step towards resolving the issue at hand, and will be the subject of this blog post!\n\n<img src={issueImage} alt=\"Issue\"/>\n\nThe issue at hand: [layer5#211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211) - add comparative spectrums to the Landscape page\n\n* * *\n\n_**Note:** this blog post will frequently reference [the update and documentation comment that I made](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644) to accompany my last commit to my PR. I consider this hefty comment to be an extension of this blog post, so I strongly recommend giving it a read!_\n\n* * *\n\nMy initial commit towards introducing comparative spectrum tooling did not represent a full solution. Thinking about what might constitute a full solution for the issue at hand, I came up with three criteria:\n\n## What was still needed:\n\n#### 1\\. A complete toolset\n\nWithin [Issue #211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211), Layer5 lead developer Lee indicates [four slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6) upon which comparative spectrum graphics may be based upon. During my initial commit, I created graphics that emulated those found within the first three of those four slides, but I had yet to implement the graphic found in [the fourth](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p12): a table. I was also less-than-satisfied with the 'grid' design I had implemented in response to [slide 7](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p10).\n\n#### 2\\. A modular design\n\nThe designs I am implementing are meant to be used to present opinionated information. As I am not nearly knowledgeable to form opinionated comparisons between service meshes and related technologies, I have instead made my goal to make it as easy as possible for other Layer5 contributors to utilize the graphics (\"\\[comparative\\] spectrums\") that I am designing. Doing so would require encapsulating (templating) the spectrums I design (new and old), within their own HTML files, and providing a means to easily invoke (and customize) instances of those templates into the Landscape page.\n\n#### 3\\. Documentation\n\nBecause the templates I design are intended to be implemented and customized by other contributors, it is _especially_ critical that those contributors have access to complete and thorough documentation detailing the intended use of each templated design.\n\n* * *\n\n## What I delivered:\n\n#### 1\\. A complete toolset\n\nAs documented in my [update comment](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644), I designed a table that very closely resembles that of Lee's slides. Implementing the table was interesting, as it ended up requiring [quite a few nested Liquid for-loops](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/4d396aaa6d3ca46add71531daedc8c0e2a5d2495/_includes/partials/spectrum/table.html#L23). Also as documented, I revamped the grid-based tooling and am quite pleased with the improvements made. The end result of these efforts is a complete set of comparative spectrums.\n\n#### 2, 3. A modular design and documentation\n\nThe bulk of the documentation I wrote details how to deal with the modular solution that I designed and implemented to enable comparative spectrums to be included into the Landscape page (through the use of Liquid `include` tags). The documentation speaks for itself; [check it out!](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-561613644)\n\n## What's next?\n\nI would not have considered the documentation I delivered to be complete if I did not report on the issues still present in the work I delivered. I denoted these as 'Current issues' in the documentation, and they represent work that still remains to be done. I know that I can count on the Layer5 community to assist me with small issues like these, and, once this pull request receives some forward motion, I hope to start zeroing in on its smaller issues. Fortunately, I have made plans to continue working with open source well into the new year!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Layer5: Landscape Spectrums Revisited","date":"Dec 4th, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/e1337065d328292a21fe09e154fd04d8/landscape_green.svg"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/e1337065d328292a21fe09e154fd04d8/landscape_green.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/landscape/layer5-landscape-spectrums-revisited"}},{"id":"94ec3b54-c4c3-53cd-ad1b-e5a628ad968e","body":"\n\nimport pr211 from \"./PR-211.webp\";\nimport pr2112 from \"./PR-211-2.webp\";\nimport card1 from \"./card1.webp\";\nimport card2 from \"./card2.webp\";\nimport arrow from \"./arrow.webp\";\nimport gtable from \"./graphical-table.webp\";\nimport gcomp from \"./graph-compare.webp\";\nimport image21 from \"./image.webp\";\nimport comment from \"./comment.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nDuring [Hacktoberfest 2019](https://raungar.wordpress.com/tag/layer5/), I worked on the website of [Layer5](https://layer5.io/), open source community. More specifically, my contributions concerned one specific page of that website: its [Service Mesh Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape).\n\nShortly after making these contributions, I was graciously welcomed into the Layer5 community by its lead developer [Lee Calcote](https://twitter.com/lcalcote?lang=en), who later directly approached me to assist him in furthering his vision for the Landscape page by implementing \"comparative spectrums\". Wishing to focus on my remaining two Hacktoberfest contributions at the time, I suggested surveying the interest of other potential contributors for this project. As such, an informative issue was opened:\n\n<img src={pr211} alt=\"PR 211\"/>\n\nIssue [layer5#211](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/211): add comparative spectrums to the Landscape page\n\nA month later, I fortunately found time enough to make some major progress into this issue.\n\n* * *\n\nThis issue is quite highly conceptual, much moreso than any other issue I have thus far worked on. I decided that the best way to approach this issue would be to focus on establishing a set of tools that could be used by more-knowledgeable contributors to later construct comparative spectrums—opinionated data visualizations. As such, my first step was to build a set of responsive graphical elements that resembled [those provided as examples](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6). These include:\n\n#### (1) _Sleek information cards:_\n\n<table>\n    <tbody>\n    <tr>\n    <td><img src={card1} alt=\"Card\"/></td>\n    <td> or this </td>\n    <td><img src={card2} alt=\"Card\"/></td>\n    </tr>\n    </tbody>\n</table>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slides 5 and 6](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6))_\n\n#### (2) _Gradiented, labelable double-arrow banners:_\n\n<img src={arrow} alt=\"Arrow\"/>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slide 5](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6))_\n\n#### (3) _Graphically-augmented tables:_\n\n<img src={gtable} alt=\"Table\"/>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slide 8](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p12))_\n\n#### (4) _Spectrum-like graphical comparisons:_\n\n<img src={gcomp} alt=\"Comparison\"/>\n\n_(Source: [ONIF Container Networking Panel, slide 7](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P6LzzG0_alAxshpdfLnix53S9WU4vjbpSCrHJQoWPqc/edit#slide=id.p6))_\n\n* * *\n\n(1) Although there may exist libraries that may help construct such graphical elements, I did not want to introduce additional libraries to accomplish my work. Instead, I wanted to make good use of Layer5io's preexisting [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) library. Fortunately, Materialize strongly supports the design of card-like structures, allowing me to more easily [implement some](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-20fc098534d6aab31ad8e5c9db51bde0R10).\n\n(2) Unfortunately, it does not seem that Materialize supports the creation of graphical arrows, so I just ended up [styling my own](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-1d5fe92e61759723c94b009b32e9e1b7R2).\n\n(3) These tables can be quite easily implemented and styled with or without the use of `<table>` tags. I anticipate these will be given a proper fleshing out after the other graphical elements are further developed.\n\n(4) These unique spectrum graphics present the most challenging, of all the comparison tools, to implement. Snaking spectrum bar aside, I needed to develop a _responsive_ solution that (a) allowed contributors to programmatically place image thumbnails at preset horizontal positions, while (b) ensuring those thumbnails placed at the same position do not overlap with one another (and instead align vertically atop each other).\n\nThis presented a problem to solve: I required a means to 'float' elements toward a horizontal line; to 'stack' thumbnails atop one another, without overlap, if they are given the same horizontal position. After researching quite deeply into potential solutions to this problem, I ended up stumbling across some CSS property-value pairings that I had never heard of before: [`display: grid`](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) and [`grid-auto-flow: row dense`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_grid-auto-flow.asp). Miraculously, I discovered that these could actually function as [a basis for a solution](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238/files#diff-1d5fe92e61759723c94b009b32e9e1b7R76).\n\n* * *\n\nAfter styling the graphical elements, I continued the website's trend of using [Liquid](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid) tags (e.g. [`for`](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid/tags/iteration-tags#for)) and [YAML lists](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) to help modularize my solutions, which should aid future contributors in generalizing them.\n\n* * *\n\nI opened [a pull request](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238) to share my work as well as invite collaboration:\n\n<img src={pr2112} alt=\"PR 211-2\"/>\n\nPull request [layer5#238](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238): description of tooling introduced\n\n<img src={image21} alt=\"Image\"/>\n\nPull request [layer5#238](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238): example images of tooling introduced\n\nThe pull request was quite well-recieved:\n\n<img src={comment} alt=\"Comment\"/>\n\n[Comment](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238#issuecomment-554181763) by Layer5 team lead on pull request [layer5#238](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/238)\n\nAs I mentioned in a recent Layer5 community meeting, I am very excited to continue working with Layer5; to refine and expand upon this set of new, visionary tooling for their landscape!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Introducing Comparative Spectrums to the Layer5 Landscape","date":"Nov 15th, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/e1337065d328292a21fe09e154fd04d8/landscape_green.svg"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/e1337065d328292a21fe09e154fd04d8/landscape_green.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/landscape/introducing-comparative-spectrums-to-the-layer5-landscape"}},{"id":"c8e6f627-3928-5937-8cef-5afff4fdcc96","body":"\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n(ICYMI: [I've made my first-ever Hacktoberfest contribution](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/hacktoberfest-2019-documenting-my-first-ever-hacktoberfest-contribution/)!)_\n\n[Hacktoberfest 2019](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) is now well underway, and I am happy to report that I have made my second contribution to my new favorite open source community, [**Layer5**](https://layer5.io/) ([on GitHub](https://github.com/layer5io))!\n\n_Before I continue on, I want to extend a huge thank-you to Layer5's lead developer, Lee Calcote, as well as the Layer5 community managers for welcoming me into the Layer5 Slack channel, allowing me to introduce myself in their weekly community meeting, and even giving my blog [an awesome shout out on Twitter](https://twitter.com/layer5/status/1180317604168306688?s=12)!_\n\n* * *\n\nThis week, I helped resolve the very first issue that I outlined in my [Planning for #Hacktoberfest 2019](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/) post:\n\n[![](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-4.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-4.webp?w=1024)\n\nIssue [layerio#65](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65): enhancements for the [Layer5 Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape)\n\nAt the time I found this issue, the second requested enhancement (concerning table row coloration) [was already handled](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/commit/b313268cb578e762d1212c9910b522af2869b57b) by another contributor, leaving me with two tasks:\n\n1. Implementing the specified sorting functionalities (for the three tables on the [Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape))\n2. Restyling the font color of site hyperlinks (an enhancement [requested later on](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65#issuecomment-483912458) in the issue)\n\n### The strange case of Jekyll\n\nFortunately, thanks to my previous work with Layer5's website, I was already all set up with an offline development environment. However, going into my first task, I knew very little about Jekyll except how to install it.\n\n_[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)... it's got to be like React or Angular, right? I mean, all I need to do is slap in [sort](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/sort/) and [reverse filters](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/reverse/) and toggle them onclick, right_...?\n\n_...Wait, what's a \"static site generator\"?_\n\n* * *\n\nAfter discovering what Jekyll and Liquid actually were, I determined that I would have to resort to DOM manipulation to fully accomplish my first task. However, I did succeed in accomplishing the default sorting behaviour by enhancing the Liquid tags being used by several tables.\n\nTo do so, I followed coding style on the issue's previous contributor by encapsulating my work within a new JavaScript file in the project's assets folder: a simple bubble sort function.\n\nI chose to implement the [simplest of sorting algorithms](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/js/table-sort.js#L13) in JavaScript (which I count as study for my _Data Structures and Algorithms_ midterm):\n\n\n```\n// Excerpted from https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/js/table-sort.js\nlet bubbleSort = () => {\n  for (i = 0; i < rows.length-1; i++) {\n    for (j = 0; j < rows.length-i-1; j++) {\n      if (shouldSwap(text(j), text(j+1))) {\n        rows[j].parentNode.insertBefore(rows[j+1], rows[j]);\n        didSort = true;\n      }\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Painting over Pumpkin Bread\n\n[Encycolorpedia.com](https://encycolorpedia.com) lists the hex color code `#fdac40` as \"[Valspar Paint Pumpkin Bread](https://encycolorpedia.com/fdac40)\". Although Layer5.io's then-difficult-to-read hyperlinks were colored `#ffa_b_40`, I'd still like to think that the second task of my second Hacktoberfest contribution was festively-themed!\n\nIn [my last blog post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/10/02/hacktoberfest-2019-documenting-my-first-ever-hacktoberfest-contribution/), I mentioned that [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com) was worth further research. Well, after some poking around, I discovered that all of Layer5.io's pumpkin-colored hyperlink styling (both deliberate, and incidental) originated from its materialize.css asset.\n\nAlthough this asset has been [frequently modified](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/commits/master/assets/css/materialize.css), I was still hesitant to globally alter the site's styling (in case a return to Pumpkin Bread was desired in the future), so I instead opted to [add a new inline style tag](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209/files#diff-48443fc170100677376b7ee11324494b) to override [a styling rule](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/assets/css/materialize.css#L5149) (on top of removing the 'orange-text' class from individual anchor elements).\n\n* * *\n\nAll of the changes I've made can be viewed through [my (merged) pull request](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209):\n\n[![](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-6.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-6.webp?w=1024)\n\nPull request [layer5io#209](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/209): resolved the remainder of issue [layerio#65](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65)\n\n* * *\n\nI am very fortunate to be so well-supported by the open source communities I have worked with so far, both on-campus and abroad. With their support behind me, I feel equipped to start learning what I need to know to resolve the next two more-difficult issues that lie ahead of me!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Hacktoberfest 2019: Heating up!","date":"Oct 12th, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmAAAABXRUJQVlA4IFQAAABQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJSz5KEeJwv+PzUAD+7wl6+yEv9BssN9qcF/+Vik2UCes/yTezQI30xu+pQ6rpt6lhwheaENfyHOgAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1bb03/hacktoberfestw2.webp","srcSet":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/90996/hacktoberfestw2.webp 750w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/f5ef2/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1080w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1e91f/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1366w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1bb03/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1918w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5291970802919708}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/hacktoberfestw2.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRmAAAABXRUJQVlA4IFQAAABQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJSz5KEeJwv+PzUAD+7wl6+yEv9BssN9qcF/+Vik2UCes/yTezQI30xu+pQ6rpt6lhwheaENfyHOgAAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1bb03/hacktoberfestw2.webp","srcSet":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/90996/hacktoberfestw2.webp 750w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/f5ef2/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1080w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1e91f/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1366w,\n/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/1bb03/hacktoberfestw2.webp 1918w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5291970802919708}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/456e2798620add5212a4c7b22406351a/hacktoberfestw2.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/landscape/hacktoberfest-2019-heating-up"}},{"id":"172f6ae5-8002-5100-a4f7-cba43f99c1be","body":"\n\n\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nIn [my last post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/), I identified three GitHub issues to kick off my participation in Hacktoberfest 2019.

[RedHat.com](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/microservices/what-is-a-service-mesh) helpfully defines a service mesh as \"a dedicated infrastructure layer\" of an application that controls how different parts of that application (\"services\") share data with one another (i.e. 'mesh together').\n\n* * *\n\n### Selecting my first Hacktoberfest issue\n\nAs I mentioned my last post, I came into contact with Layer5 after discovering (through the [Hacktoberfest Issue Finder](https://hacktoberfest-finder.netlify.com/)) its [issue regarding table filtering](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65)—and subsequently discovered an unreported styling issue. [![A styling issue with a collection of lists hosted on Layer5's Landscape page.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66007380-2d643700-e480-11e9-8bda-e81dd0e166d9.webp)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66007380-2d643700-e480-11e9-8bda-e81dd0e166d9.webp)\n\nA styling issue affected a collection of lists hosted on Layer5's [Landscape page](https://layer5.io/landscape).\n\nOf the three GitHub issues I've scoped out, the resolution of this styling issue (i.e. tweaking CSS) represents the simplest of tasks that I have lined up—and an ideal candidate for a first-time Hacktoberfest contribution!\n\nAs far as I could tell, no open issues concerned the styling problem that I discovered. So, as instructed both Layer5's website (and encouraged its extremely-welcoming development team), I opened _my own issue_ - [Enhance landscape categories section wrapping (#191)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191).\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-1.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-1.webp?w=1024)\n\n### Identifying a solution\n\nTo address this issue, I came up with the idea of realigning the category list items horizontally, transforming the poorly-behaving columns of category 'cards' into rows in a responsive and easily-scalable vertical stack.\n\nImplementating this idea proved quite simple, requiring only [a few added CSS rules](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508), which I first accomplished by tinkering with the live webpage's styling (with the help of the [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) browser extension):\n\n\n```css\n.card .card-content li {\n  float: right;\n  width: 200px;\n}\n.card .card-content {\n  border-right: unset;\n  padding: 0 0 5px 0;\n}\n.card .card-content:not(:last-child) {\n  border-bottom-width: 1px;\n  border-bottom-style: dashed;\n  border-bottom-color: var(--main-dark-grey);\n}\n```\n\nThe vertical stack is implemented by the rules in the first selector: list items are floated right and assigned a fixed width, which aligns them neatly. The dashed borders and padding used to separate category lists was also adjusted to accomodate the new design (pictured below):\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66013483-5e049a80-e499-11e9-8920-52c3da81ece7.webp)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13500769/66013483-5e049a80-e499-11e9-8920-52c3da81ece7.webp)\n\nThe above image is one of the [two mockups of the redesign](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537304508) that I produced for the consideration of the project's developers. As luck would have it, Layer5 project lead [Lee Calcote](https://github.com/leecalcote) provided [a lightning-quick response](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537310179), welcoming a pull request to it!\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/191#issuecomment-537310179](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-2.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-2.webp?w=1024)\n\n#### Future research area: Materialize CSS\n\nI discovered that the 'cards' comprising the category section are styled using [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/). I considered using this framework in my solution, but ultimately decided to opt for a simple, intuitive solution. This framework appears interesting, and would definitely merits research were this a more-involved styling task.\n\n## Implementing the solution\n\nWhile using my browser's developer tools to tinker with styling, I discovered an inline `style` tag that serviced the categories section. I determined that this tag would present the best place to add the styling rules that I wrote (following the coding style of a prior contributor).\n\nFinding the location of this `style` tag (i.e. of the \"Service Mesh Landscape\" page) in the source code was a lot more trouble than I thought it would be. After paging through too many HTML documents, I gave in and used Visual Studio's global search functionality to locate it.\n\n## Testing the solution\n\nAlthough I knew that my styling worked well when loaded from a browser extension, before I could contribute code, I needed to ensure that the styling worked equally-well when loaded inline from an HTML document. Little did I know, at that time, what I would be getting myself into...\n\n#### Ruby, Gems and Jekyll? `rvm`, `bundle` and `make`?\n\nPicking through my ~/.bash\\_history file, here is the sequence of Bash shell commands that I issued (via WSL Ubuntu) in order to execute a local copy of the layer5 website (annotated for your convenience):\n```sh\n## Install dependency packages ##\nsudo apt-get install build-essential\nsudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n\n## Install specific version of Ruby via Ruby Version Manager ##\nsudo apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/rvm\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install rvm\nrvm install \"ruby-2.6.3\" # install specific version of Ruby specified in Layer5's Gemfile\n                         # (Yes, it must be that exact version.)\n\n## Configure RubyGems ##\necho 'export GEM\\_HOME=\"$HOME/gems\"' >> ~/.bashrc\necho 'export PATH=\"$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n## Install Jekyll and dependencies ##\ngem install jekyll bundler\nbundle install           # install dependencies listed in Gemfile\n\n## Execute project! ##\nmake site                # references Layer5's Makefile\n                         # alias for \"bundle exec jekyll serve --drafts --livereload\"\n```\n#### Stray thoughts on documentation\n\nReflecting back on the process, a question has stuck with me: how much should projects hold the hands of novice contributors? Setting up the means to run `make site` is not included within Layer5's [CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). As such, for the most novice of contributors, like myself (who have never even heard of `make` before), setting up the prerequisite development environment presented a lengthy and piecemeal (albeit ultimately valuable) learning experience.\n\nHow much documentation is too little? Too much? How high should the bar be set for contribution? I suppose it is up to the project's community to decide upon the answers to these questions themselves (and write documentation, accordingly).\n\n## Creating a pull request\n\nAfter successfully testing and fixing the styling on my local fork, I created [a pull request](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192):\n\n[![https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-3.webp?w=1024)](https://raungar.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/image-3.webp?w=1024)\n\nPull request – [Restyle landscape categories (#192)](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/pull/192)\n\n...and it got merged! First Hacktoberfest contribution, completed!\n\n## Up next!\n\nI ended [my last post](https://raungar.wordpress.com/2019/09/27/planning-for-hacktoberfest-2019/) by stating that I have yet to gain any experience with makefiles. Well, thanks to my work on Layer5, that is no longer true: I have since used a makefile (to launch a Jekyll executable)! This experience will undoubtedly save me some time with resolving [the Comcast issue I found](https://github.com/Comcast/RestfulHttpsProxy/issues/5)! However, the next Hacktoberfest issue I resolve will be [_the first one I blogged about_](https://github.com/layer5io/layer5/issues/65).\n\nStay tuned!\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Hacktoberfest 2019: documenting my first-ever Hacktoberfest contribution","date":"Oct 2nd, 2019","author":"Rafi Ungar","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRloAAABXRUJQVlA4IE4AAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBOmUABoYvU9NMjx4AAA/unYNY0j50yc89GNLIP6rauqdpcibgLI2+1q4hGoAKRe7ytAIAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/c42f2/hacktoberfest.webp","srcSet":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/25655/hacktoberfest.webp 750w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/d8caf/hacktoberfest.webp 1080w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/bbff9/hacktoberfest.webp 1366w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/c42f2/hacktoberfest.webp 1894w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.4736008447729672}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/hacktoberfest.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRloAAABXRUJQVlA4IE4AAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBOmUABoYvU9NMjx4AAA/unYNY0j50yc89GNLIP6rauqdpcibgLI2+1q4hGoAKRe7ytAIAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/c42f2/hacktoberfest.webp","srcSet":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/25655/hacktoberfest.webp 750w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/d8caf/hacktoberfest.webp 1080w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/bbff9/hacktoberfest.webp 1366w,\n/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/c42f2/hacktoberfest.webp 1894w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.4736008447729672}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/ecc709d731c60e749f353b70e1eafa40/hacktoberfest.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/landscape/hacktoberfest-2019-documenting-my-first-ever-hacktoberfest-contribution"}},{"id":"cac9ddb8-17d6-5815-b6a0-3a849328003b","body":"\n\nimport wsldockerstart from \"./wsl-docker-start.webp\";\nimport wslgrafanalogin from \"./wsl-grafana-login.webp\";\nimport wslgrafanaloginsuccess from \"./wsl-grafana-login-success.webp\";\nimport wslgrafanastart from \"./wsl-grafana-start.webp\";\nimport wslk3dstart from \"./wsl-k3d-start.webp\";\nimport wslmesherycomplete from \"./wsl-meshery-complete.webp\";\nimport wslmesherylogin from \"./wsl-meshery-login.webp\";\nimport wslmesheryloginsuccess from \"./wsl-meshery-login-success.webp\";\nimport wslmesherystart from \"./wsl-meshery-start.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\nDuring KubeCon EU 2019, I had the chance to discover two new softwares that simply amazed me:\n1. [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery), which is the multi-service mesh management plane.\n2. [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d), which is used to create a dockerized [k3s](https://k3s.io) server.\n\nAnd, what really appealed to me about both of them is that everything from the installation to the usage was just *simple!*\nAnd cream on the top, both softwares are used with or inside containers, making each ideal for a create/try/delete workflow.\n\n<h4>Environment Setup</h4>\n\nBefore we start having *real* fun with Meshery, I will quickly list the different components I used for this blog post and ensure I define what could be optional for your own setup:\n1. [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery)\n2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)\n    - Docker is of course mandatory and as Meshery is based on a Compose file, which means that [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is also mandatory.\n3. [k3d](https://github.com/rancher/k3d)\n    - k3d or any k3s/K8s cluster that you might have already configured.\n4. [WSL2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/)\n    - For the (few) ones who know me, my \"OS base\" is WSL2, which means that without much/any change, it should run fine for any Linux/MacOS setup.\n5. [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) *(optional)*\n    - Grafana is not mandatory however is strongly recommend. We will setup a dockerized instance, but feel free to plug Meshery with your existing instance.\n\n<h4> Nothing is taken for granted </h4>\n\nFor the sake of making the blog post around Meshery, I won't explain how to install each component and will focus only on getting k3d and Meshery working.\n\nThat said, I do not take anything for granted and as Scott Hanselman once taught me: there is no \"just have to ...\" or \"by simply doing ...\".\n\nIf you face any issue with your setup (hopefully WSL2), just let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nunixtech) or on the [Layer5 Slack channel](http://slack.layer5.io).\n\n<h4>Meshery Installation</h4>\n\nFor the following steps, I will use the Ubuntu 18.04 WSL2 distro:\n\n- Start docker and confirm it's running:\n\n```bash\nsudo service docker start\ndocker version\n```\n\n- Using Docker, install Meshery on your local machine by running the following:\n\n```bash\ncurl -L https://meshery.io/install | PLATFORM=kubernetes bash -\n```\n<a href={wsldockerstart}>\n    <img src={wsldockerstart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wsl-docker-start\" />\n</a>\n\n- Create a new k3d cluster with the <code> WSL2 IP </code>\n\n```bash\nexport mainIP=`hostname -I | awk '{ print $1 }'`\nk3d list\nk3d create --workers 3 --api-port ${mainIP}:6443\nexport KUBECONFIG=\"$(k3d get-kubeconfig --name='k3s-default')\"\nkubectl cluster-info\n```\n\n<a href={wslk3dstart}>\n    <img src={wslk3dstart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslk3dstart\" />\n</a>\n<br/>\n- Start Meshery on the newly created cluster\n\n```bash\nmesheryctl system start\n```\n\n<a href={wslmesherystart}>\n    <img src={wslmesherystart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslmesherystart\" />\n</a>\n- Once Meshery is fully started, login in your preferred browser using the <code>WSL2 IP</code> instead of <code>localhost</code>\n\n```bash\nexport BROWSER=/mnt/c/Firefox/firefox.exe\n$BROWSER $mainIP:9081 &\n```\n\n<a href={wslmesherylogin}>\n        <img src={wslmesherylogin} alt=\"wslmesherylogin\" />\n</a>\n<a href={wslmesheryloginsuccess}>\n    <img src={wslmesheryloginsuccess} alt=\"wslmesheryloginsuccess\" />\n</a>\n\n\n#### [Optional] More analytics with Grafana\nAs stated above, Meshery can leverage the analytics provided by Grafana. For this blog post, as everything is built from scratch. Here is the setup for a new Grafana dockerized instance.\n\nStart a new Grafana on docker instance\n\n```bash\ndocker run \\\n-d \\\n-p 3000:3000 \\\n--name=grafana \\\n-e \"GF_SERVER_ROOT_URL=http://$mainIP\" \\\n-e \"GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=MesheryInstance\" \\\ngrafana/grafana\n```\n\n<a href={wslgrafanastart}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanastart} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanastart\" />\n</a>\n\n- Access the new instance with the admin password that you set in the docker environment variable\n```bash\n$BROWSER $mainIP:3000 &\n```\n\n<a href={wslgrafanalogin}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanalogin} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanalogin\" />\n</a>\n<br />\n<a href={wslgrafanaloginsuccess}>\n    <img src={wslgrafanaloginsuccess} className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslgrafanaloginsuccess\" />\n</a>\n\n### An inside look\nWhile everything should run fine, it's always good to have a look at what has been deployed.\n\nIn this case, we are almost exclusively working with Docker and the \"inside look\" should look something like this:\n\n<a href={wslmesherycomplete}>\n    <img src={wslmesherycomplete}className=\"thumbnail\" alt=\"wslmesherycomplete\" />\n</a>\n\n#### Conclusion\nAs [Lee Calcote](https://twitter.com/lcalcote) put it, this is a lot of buzz words: Meshery > k3s (deployed via k3d) > Docker > WSL2 > Windows 10. And he's totally right, still the \"beauty\" here, is that it \"simply works\".\n\nSince the begin of the Docker era, new tooling has appeard for simplifying complex workflows.\nEven Kubernetes (K8s) as a much lighter version with k3s by Rancher.\n\nAnd of course, Meshery which integrates and simplifies the installation and benchmarking of different service meshes. Hope you had fun assembling all these pieces and stay tunned for the \"Bonuses\", more fun to come!\n\n<span> > > > <i>Nunix out</i></span>\n\n\n</BlogWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Getting started with Meshery, WSL2 and k3d","date":"Jul 9th, 2019","author":"Nuno do Carmo","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrgAAABXRUJQVlA4IKwAAAAwBQCdASoUABQAPtFgqU+oJSOiKAgBABoJagDHMywTmwXkh8XuWw62pPgeLa6iGOkYAAD+9R4SKH1oL6udrBkwr5rrkLRIeudVijKFQQi4NBpAgn1GqiLKGll7/coQQQ8X2m4ARFICZ1eH4EKwlMH79KOgYAEP9qeZU1fXG+Jmj3mSYoA/SF+9X/WI4UZXzEZSPBXefiBldNQhjxeWdjq9FujdEnATM/mAAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp 400w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/cnab-logo.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRrgAAABXRUJQVlA4IKwAAAAwBQCdASoUABQAPtFgqU+oJSOiKAgBABoJagDHMywTmwXkh8XuWw62pPgeLa6iGOkYAAD+9R4SKH1oL6udrBkwr5rrkLRIeudVijKFQQi4NBpAgn1GqiLKGll7/coQQQ8X2m4ARFICZ1eH4EKwlMH79KOgYAEP9qeZU1fXG+Jmj3mSYoA/SF+9X/WI4UZXzEZSPBXefiBldNQhjxeWdjq9FujdEnATM/mAAAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp","srcSet":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/416c3/cnab-logo.webp 400w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":1}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/4c732e28e50f90fde2ff41201d6d0743/cnab-logo.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/meshery/getting-started-with-meshery-wsl2-and-k3d"}},{"id":"fbc0a4e6-e2df-5139-835a-843d390eaa13","body":"\n\nimport SmiLogo from \"./smi-logo.webp\";\n\n<BlogWrapper>\n\n<img className=\"image-left\" src={SmiLogo} alt=\"SMI Logo\"/>\n\nMost began their cloud native journey with their first step being use of containers, and taking a second step, moved into container orchestration as their workloads grew. Now, waves and waves of organizations are considering service meshes as their third significant step in their cloud native journey. As they invest into service meshes as their next layer of key infrastructure, users will continue to look for the same assurances sought from other commonly accepted (standard) interfaces for container runtimes (e.g. CRI), container storage (e.g. CSI), container networking (e.g. CNI) and they will look for a commonly accepted service mesh interface.\n\nAs a prominent supporter of management software for multiple service meshes, Layer5 is pleased to partner with Microsoft in support of the [Service Mesh Interface](https://smi-spec.io) (SMI). The Service Mesh Interface is a specification for service meshes that run on Kubernetes. As such, SMI defines a common standard that can be implemented by a variety of service mesh projects and vendors.\n\nLike standards before SMI, consistent APIs inspire confidence in infrastructure stability, community-managed APIs assuage technology and vendor lock-in concerns, and steward the resounding of core use cases, resulting in streamlining the smaller, but critical-to-users, subset of capabilities offered across the [service mesh landscape](https://layer5.io/landscape).\n\nMeshery and SMI are aligned on common goals of getting users started quickly, understanding that users want service mesh technology, but have questions as to which service mesh use, how, and when to get started through a common interface. Meshery’s playground capabilities quick provision a variety of service meshes and reduce time to value and time to understanding for those adopting a service mesh.\n\nAs a multi-mesh manager, Meshery, understands that each service mesh has it own strengths. SMI intends to allow for differentiation by service mesh providers, at the same time providing interoperability between service meshes and their surrounding tooling. As a management plane, Meshery enhances networking intelligence in a multi-mesh way, encouraging users to expect more from their infrastructure.

Buf is one of those projects. This post presents an overview of Buf.</p></div>\n\n\n## What is Buf?\n\n<p>A tool to make Protobuf reliable and easy to use for service owners and clients, while keeping it the obvious choice on the technical merits.\nOur organization should not have to reinvent the wheel to create, maintain, and consume Protobuf APIs efficiently and effectively. It will handle our Protobuf management strategy for us, so we can focus on what matters.</p>\n\n<div className=\"fact\">Learn more about Buf Protocol, visit <a href=\"https://buf.build\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buf Protocol</a> or their documentation at <a href=\"https://docs.buf.build/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buf Protocol Docs</a></div>\n\n<img className=\"problem-image\" src={Problems} />\n\n## Features \n\n- Automatic file discovery. \n- Selectable configuration - 40 lint checkers and 54 breaking checkers\n- Selectable error output - `file:line:col:message`\n- Check anything from anywhere - proto files, tar, git, pre-built images or file descriptors.\n- [Speed](https://docs.buf.build/tour-8/) - Its internal compiler is super fast (approx. 4x then Protoc)\n- Can use buf as a protoc plugin instead of using it as a standalone tool.\n\n## Buf CLI\n\nBuf attempts to simplify your Protocol Buffers workflow using the Buf CLI and protoc plugins. The Buf CLI currently provides:\n\n- A linter that enforces good API design choices and structure.\n- A breaking change detector that enforces compatibility at the source code level or wire level.\n- A generator that invokes your protoc plugins based on a configurable template. A protoc replacement that uses Buf's newly-developed high performance Protobuf compiler.\n- A configurable file builder that produces Images, our extension of FileDescriptorSets.\n\n## Comparison Between Protobuf and Buf\nLayer5 projects currently use protoc as the tool for building their protobuf defintions. The following are some considerations made while determining whether to use Buf.\n\n- Protobuf is not as widely adopted as JSON.\n- API Structure \n  - No standards enforcement\n  - Inconsistency can arise across an organization's Protobuf APIs,   \n  - Design decisions can be made that can affect your API's future iterability.\n- Backward Compatibility\n- Stub distribution\n- Tooling\n\n<p>Buf aims to solve the above problems and it's long-term goal is to enable schema-driven development: A future where APIs are defined consistently, in a way that service owners and us can depend on</p>\n\n## Roadmap to Adopting Buf\nIn consideration of the use of Buf, we would adopt it in phases, starting with the following ares of integration.\n\n- **API Structure  Enforcements**\n  - Linter solves this issue by enforcing standards. \n  - Also, we don’t need to use Buf as a standalone tool we can just use linter as plugins.\n\n\n- **Backward Compatibility**\n  - It will check for different things that can cause breaking change.\n  - For example, type change.\n\n<div className=\"intro\"><p>If these topics excite you and you want to explore more <a href=\"/resources\">cloud native technolgies</a>, come and say \"Hi\" on the community <a href=\"http://slack.layer5.io\">Slack</a> and you are sure to be warmly welcomed. <span>😀</span></p></div>\n\n</BufProtocol>\n</BlogWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"Rethinking Protocol Buffers with Buf","date":"May 24th, 2021","author":"Adithya Krishna","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnAAAABXRUJQVlA4IGQAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJQBOgA+Tk8aehcycAAP7ATvlxq/O19EhA9XrL+2Tj+Q03SbYzgyfckaPxQws5+ikk5FoYgfquExjejLHTZGOL/rxz2A413CEfQgAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/467a8/buf-protocol.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/b9516/buf-protocol.webp 750w,\n/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/2a327/buf-protocol.webp 1080w,\n/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/2a401/buf-protocol.webp 1366w,\n/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/467a8/buf-protocol.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5619791666666667}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/buf-protocol.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnAAAABXRUJQVlA4IGQAAACQAwCdASoUAAsAPtFUpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJQBOgA+Tk8aehcycAAP7ATvlxq/O19EhA9XrL+2Tj+Q03SbYzgyfckaPxQws5+ikk5FoYgfquExjejLHTZGOL/rxz2A413CEfQgAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/467a8/buf-protocol.webp","srcSet":"/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/b9516/buf-protocol.webp 750w,\n/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/2a327/buf-protocol.webp 1080w,\n/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/2a401/buf-protocol.webp 1366w,\n/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/467a8/buf-protocol.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5619791666666667}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/f9bfdf0ed6d91ee82471bb9f41472183/buf-protocol.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/blog/cloud-native/rethinking-protocol-buffers-with-buf"}}]}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["1376321266","1485533831","2848499768","3205812809","4047814605","961506260"],"matchPath":"/blog"}
