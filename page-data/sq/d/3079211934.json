[IstioCon](https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2021/about/) is a 100% virtual event that is designed to connect community members across the globe with Istio and the Istio ecosystem.\n\nLayer5 will kickoff the event with our renowned service mesh workshop, featuring [Meshery](/meshery), the service mesh manager. Attend our workshop to help you get started with managing your own service mesh!\n\n#### Using Istio\n\nAs the third phase in your microservices journey, service meshes provide a substrate of secure connectivity, uniform visibility and granular control over service requests. Service meshes have quickly entered the cloud native landscape filling unmet service-level needs. Organizations that have adopted containers and who are running a handful or more of microservices find tools to provide observability, control and security lacking. Operating at layer 5, service meshes promise much value. This live training walks you through a series of hands-on labs, introducing you to each and every aspect of the popular service mesh - Istio. During this workshop you will gain hands-on experience as we walk through deploying Istio alongside microservices running in Kubernetes.\n\nYou will learn to:\n\n- Configure and operate Istio in context of an example workloads and their common use cases\n- Manage traffic through load balancing and resilient communications\n- Enforce policies and rate limiting\n- Be confident with ongoing management of Istio\n- Understand WebAssembly filters for Envoy and deploy a custom filter\n\n#### [Workshop Labs](https://github.com/layer5io/advanced-istio-service-mesh-workshop)\n\nSee link for self-paced study.\n\n#### [Workshop Slides](https://calcotestudios.com/talks/decks/slides-istiocon-2021-using-istio.html)\n\n<iframe width=\"50%\" height=\"400px;\" src=\"https://calcotestudios.com/talks/decks/slides-istiocon-2021-using-istio.html\" loading=\"lazy\"></iframe>\n\n\n#### Workshop Recording\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/T1Kwh3SRAXQ\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowFullScreen></iframe>","frontmatter":{"title":"IstioCon: Using Istio","date":"February 22nd, 2021","slack":"http://slack.layer5.io","slides":"https://calcotestudios.com/talks/decks/slides-istiocon-2021-using-istio.html","abstract":"Understanding and using Istio - presented the inaugural IstioCon 2021","status":"delivered","labs":"https://github.com/layer5io/advanced-istio-service-mesh-workshop","video":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1Kwh3SRAXQ","eurl":"https://events.istio.io/istiocon-2021/workshops/using-istio/","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/88e79f3aa90a7116b0cc0fe4bf81160a/istiocon-logo.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/learn/service-mesh-workshops/istiocon-using-istio"}},{"id":"889df6d2-e6f8-5d82-8a9e-57dbe3537646","body":"\n### By the end of this live, hands-on, online course, you’ll understand:\n\n- How to manage traffic through load balancing and resilient communications.\n- How to enforce policies and rate limiting.\n- Istio's methods for managing telemetry, monitoring and reporting.\n- Approaches to canary deployments and securing communication with Istio.\n\n#### Advanced Istio - O'Reilly Live Online Training\n\nAs the third phase in your microservices journey, service meshes provide a substrate of secure connectivity, uniform visibility and granular control over service requests.

Organizations that have adopted containers and who are running a handful or more of microservices find tools to provide observability, control and security lacking. Operating at layer 5, service meshes promise much value. This live training walks you through a series of hands-on labs, introducing you to each and every aspect of the popular service mesh - Istio. During this workshop you will gain hands-on experience as we walk through deploying Istio alongside microservices running in Kubernetes.\n","frontmatter":{"title":"O'Reilly Live Online Training","date":"August 1st, 2019","slack":"http://slack.layer5.io","slides":"https://calcotestudios.com/talks/decks/slides-oreilly-live-online-training-introduction-to-istio-february-2020.html","abstract":"Introduction to Istio - O'Reilly Live Online Training","status":"delivered","labs":"https://github.com/leecalcote/istio-service-mesh-workshop","video":null,"eurl":"https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/introduction-to-istio/0636920282938/","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoAAAABXRUJQVlA4IHQAAADwAwCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYwCsACK3gSmil4SbWsOAAPKlMAskUDbJQTalts84RkZqgr1RA6bCn4Mq6XF/u6iMuN7pGLdWwWmaL1XuMz0/PKKytMki8RJsqfVOqMGkpv4ny+Hu+KqJbOAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e382c897f387dd391290db8e7aeef7d8/c0cf7/introduction-to-istio-dark-small.webp","srcSet":"/static/e382c897f387dd391290db8e7aeef7d8/c0cf7/introduction-to-istio-dark-small.webp 515w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5048543689320388}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/e382c897f387dd391290db8e7aeef7d8/introduction-to-istio-dark-small.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/learn/service-mesh-workshops/oreilly-live-online-training"}},{"id":"b06aa030-c296-5b81-acc3-6caed91f19be","body":"\n#### name: DockerCon NA 2018\n\nA workshop containing ten labs on the Istio service mesh.
