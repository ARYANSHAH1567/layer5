The CNCF now hosts an array of helpful packages, spanning container scheduling, observability, persistent storage, container runtime and other areas.\n\nOdds are the cloud-native DevOps tool you need has already been developed—it’s only a matter of finding it. In recent posts, we highlighted many CNCF tools across various areas. Below, we’ll gloss over each category from a birds-eye view. Click each headline for the full rundown, or read below for a summary of the tools in each category.\n\n### Scheduling  Orchestration\n<br />\nKubernetes is the most popular container scheduling tool. It can be used to automate the deployment and management of multi-cloud applications. Other scheduling and orchestration utilities from CNCF include Crossplane, Fluid, Karmada, kube-rs, Open Cluster Management and Volcano.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Observability and Analysis\n<br />\nPrometheus tops the list of observability and analysis tools. The platform can be used to power your monitoring and alerting systems with fine-grained metrics and excellent querying capabilities. Other CNCF tools for observability and analysis include Jaeger, Fluentd, Thanos, Cortex and OpenTelemetry.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Security and Compliance\n<br />\nOpen Policy Agent (OPA) can be used to unify cloud-native policies across the cloud-native stack. OPA uses a common language to express authorization policies and provides a policy engine to make authorization decisions. Other CNCF projects that deliver security-as-code include The Update Framework (TUF), Falco, Notary, cert-manager and Curiefense.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### CI/CD\n<br />\nArgo is a suite of packages that help direct jobs on Kubernetes to aid a continuous delivery pipeline. Using Argo, developers can create multi-step custom workflows and share these workflows across a cluster. Other CI/CD tools hosted by CNCF include Flux, Brigade, Keptn, OpenGitOps and OpenKruise.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Service Mesh Tools\n<br />\nLinkerd is a highly performant developer-favorite service mesh comprised of a control plane to apply configurations and a data plane that deploys its own unique proxy. This proxy can apply consistent security, observability, monitoring and telemetry features across distributed microservices. Other service mesh tools from CNCF include Kuma, Open Service Mesh (OSM), <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-interface-conformance\">Service Mesh Interface (SMI) </Link> , <Link to=\"/meshery\">Meshery</Link> and <Link to=\"/projects/service-mesh-performance\">Service Mesh Performance(SMP)</Link>.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Service Proxies\n<br />\nEnvoy is a service proxy commonly used within service meshes like Istio and Kuma. Envoy is intended to run alongside applications to help standardize networking and observability within large microservices networks. Other service proxy projects include Contour BFE and OpenELB.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Persistent Storage\n<br />\nRook is a tool that helps automate away some of the pains of managing cloud-native persistent storage. Rook supports file, block and object storage types and can be used for programmatic storage, migration, disaster recovery, monitoring and resource management. Other cloud-native persistent storage projects include Longhorn, CubeFS, K8up, OpenEBS, ORAS, Piraeus Datastore and Vineyard.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Cloud-Native Database Tools\n<br />\nTiKV is a unified distributed storage layer that can process large amounts of data. The project supports a key-value API and has rapid response times. Other cloud-native database utilities include Vitess, a clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL and SchemaHero, a Kubernetes operator for declarative database schema management.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Container Runtime\n<br />\nContainerd is an industry-standard container runtime supported by most container-based systems. Originally built as part of Docker, containerd was donated to the Linux Foundation in 2015. Other notable CNCF container runtime utilities include CRI-O, Inclavare Containers and WasmEdge Runtime.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### App Definition and Build Tools\n<br />\nHelm is a prevalent Kubernetes package manager widely used to share a manifest of dependencies. Operators often use Helm charts to find and install third-party applications. Other notable tools which help address operational concerns of Kubernetes include Buildpacks, KubeVirt, Operator Framework and Backstage.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Cloud-Native Networking\n<br />\nCilium is a tool that brings eBPF-based networking, security and observability. Cilium helps build out networking between container workloads and cross-cluster connectivity. Additional cloud-native networking utilities include Antrea, CNI-Genie, Kube-OVN, Network Service Mesh (NSM) and Submariner. There’s also the Container Network Interface (CNI), an interface specification for container networking.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Streaming and Messaging\n<br />\nCloudEvents offers a specification intended to help standardize the event-based communication from various event publisher systems. By having a way to describe events consistently, developers could solve interoperability issues. Other CNCF streaming and messaging projects include NATS, Pravega, Strimzi and Tremor.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Chaos Engineering\n<br />\nChaos Mesh is a chaos engineering platform for Kubernetes. Using Chaos Mesh, operators can push their Kubernetes deployments to the limit with stress testing, fault injections, and other testing behaviors. You can also schedule routine tests. Other cloud-native chaos testing tools from CNCF include Litmus and ChaosBlade.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Key Management\n<br />\nSPIFFE is defined as a universal identity control plane for a distributed architecture. Using SPIFFE, engineers can quickly construct a standard method to identify workloads and automatically secure service-to-service communication. SPIRE is the product-ready reference implementation of SPIFFE. Other key management tools from CNCF include Athenz and Teller.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### Edge Computing and Bare Metal\n<br />\nKubeEdge helps extend cloud-native capabilities into edge computing. It’s specifically designed with the constraints of edge nodes in mind, such as reliability and resource limitations. Other projects that help extend Kubernetes to the edge include Akri, OpenYurt and SuperEdge. Other tools aid in provisioning K8s on bare metal, such as Metal3.io and Tinkerbell.\n<br /> <br />\n\n### The Forecast Looks Cloud-Native\n<br />\nBy 2023, the <Link to=\"https://containerjournal.com/features/majority-of-apps-will-use-cloud-native-development-by-2023/\">majority of applications will be cloud-native</Link>. The cloud-native world is here to stay, and open source is the foundation to support our new era of microservices, containerization and DevOps.\n\nAlthough you could technically self-host your way through development and operations using these open source projects, organizations will most likely adopt a blend of open source, proprietary and as-a-service cloud offerings to get the job done. Regardless, it’s cool to know what’s available for free use.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that tools change from time to time. As such, you can always view the up-to-date CNCF landscape here. Stay tuned as we keep an eye on CNCF and related bodies that continue to carry the cloud-native torch forward!\n</div>\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"The Ultimate List of Open Source Cloud-Native Tools","date":"August 29th, 2022","author":"Bill Doerrfeld","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://containerjournal.com/features/the-ultimate-list-of-open-source-cloud-native-tools/","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRloAAABXRUJQVlA4IE4AAACQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBOmUI7gBvJ/BT4AAP7vXdwpN2snlSYI33stdIWxDnyQXwnvJvKqE+8uWMAXFD71RO1AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/29d51/tools.webp","srcSet":"/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/e30f5/tools.webp 750w,\n/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/29d51/tools.webp 770w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42857142857142855}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/tools.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRloAAABXRUJQVlA4IE4AAACQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJQBOmUI7gBvJ/BT4AAP7vXdwpN2snlSYI33stdIWxDnyQXwnvJvKqE+8uWMAXFD71RO1AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/29d51/tools.webp","srcSet":"/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/e30f5/tools.webp 750w,\n/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/29d51/tools.webp 770w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42857142857142855}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/d933bb2908d2076307a5899a5cb48295/tools.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/the-ultimate-list-of-open-source-cloud-native-tools"}},{"id":"0e3c402b-8ec4-5d70-ae25-47f401a3c656","body":"\n\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\n<div className=\"test\">\n\nThe open source Service Mesh Performance project is getting a new metric called MeshMark to help organizations manage and measure cloud-native environments. In cloud-native environments, the use of service mesh technologies to connect different operations is a growing trend. What isn't always clear with a service mesh though is how well it's actually working.\n\nMeshMark, an open source effort jointly announced by Intel and service mesh startup Layer5 on May 18, looks to help organizations measure and quantify the performance and value of a service mesh deployment. MeshMark is part of the Service Mesh Performance project at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which hosted its ServiceMeshCon EU event on May 18, co-located alongside KubeCon EU 2022.\n\n\"We're missing some performance characteristics,\" Lee Calcote, founder and CEO of Layer5 and co-chair of the CNCF Technical Advisory Group (TAG) Network, said during a ServiceMeshCon EU session. \"We have a need for a clear and concise way of conveying the characters and the performance of an environment.\"\n\n<h3>MeshMark Brings Metrics to Cloud-Native Service Mesh</h3>\n\nThe Service Mesh Performance project at its core is an effort to define specifications for capturing the details of a cloud-native environment in a uniform and consistent way, according to Calcote. In cloud-native environments, the use of service mesh technologies to connect different operations is a growing trend. What isn't always clear with a service mesh though is how well it's actually working.\n\nMeshMark, an open source effort jointly announced by Intel and service mesh startup Layer5 on May 18, looks to help organizations measure and quantify the performance and value of a service mesh deployment. MeshMark is part of the Service Mesh Performance project at the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), which hosted its ServiceMeshCon EU event on May 18, co-located alongside KubeCon EU 2022.\n\n\"We're missing some performance characteristics,\" Lee Calcote, founder and CEO of Layer5 and co-chair of the CNCF Technical Advisory Group (TAG) Network, said during a ServiceMeshCon EU session. \"We have a need for a clear and concise way of conveying the characters and the performance of an environment.\"\n\nThe Service Mesh Performance project looks at capturing infrastructure and service mesh configuration details and then providing a means to characterize the details of running workloads. The project also aims to provide the details in a consistent approach that can enable organizations to develop a baseline for an environment, as well as benchmark in a consistent way. Simply being aware of what's running in a service mesh isn't quite enough though, and there is a need for a performance metric, which is where the new MeshMark effort comes into play. Mrittika Ganguli, principal engineer and network architect at Intel, explained that MeshMark is a cloud-native value measurement.\n\n\"With MeshMark, you're essentially trying to measure if the performance of your infrastructure matches what kind of business value you want to get from your deployment,\" Ganguli said.\n\nA business value could be defined with key performance indicators on, for example, how well video gets loaded on a particular webpage, she said.\n\n\"If you click on something, you may often see the text get rendered first and then the video,\" Ganguli said. \"The load latency of the video traffic is what impacts what you see visually.\"\n\nMeshMark aims to provide metrics that an organization can use to determine how resources are being used. Ganguli said that in a cloud-native environment an organization is utilizing different kinds of resources. The utilization classes include, for example, compute or network or any other type of resource.\n\nMeshMark provides an efficiency metric called Mesh Utilization Efficiency (MUE) that can help determine a score for a given resource utilization and the level of optimization. The MeshMark score will be able to help identify what the load latency is for a given workload, given the available resources. Overall, the goal with MeshMark is to take a number of different signals coming from a service mesh and combine them into an approach that can help organizations understand how well a deployment is, or isn't, working.\n\nThe need to better understand the performance of service meshes was further underscored by a report released on May 17 by the CNCF. The report found that 60% of surveyed organizations are using a service mesh in production today — and that key challenges for deployment of service meshes are a lack of guidance, blueprints, and best practices.\n\n</div>\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Intel, Layer5 Announce MeshMark to Quantify Cloud-Native Performance","date":"May 21st, 2022","author":"ITPro Today","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://www.itprotoday.com/performance-management/intel-layer-5-announce-meshmark-quantify-cloud-native-performance","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlAAAABXRUJQVlA4IEQAAADwAgCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAUU0usAD+9hPekOv5EN4vIa+8oARkiR/1LCYUhAC/k+W3o2CuRwAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/cc1f6/it-pro.webp","srcSet":"/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/9860d/it-pro.webp 750w,\n/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/9ec3b/it-pro.webp 1080w,\n/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/20dcd/it-pro.webp 1366w,\n/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/cc1f6/it-pro.webp 1540w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5194805194805194}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/it-pro.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlAAAABXRUJQVlA4IEQAAADwAgCdASoUAAoAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZwAAUU0usAD+9hPekOv5EN4vIa+8oARkiR/1LCYUhAC/k+W3o2CuRwAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/cc1f6/it-pro.webp","srcSet":"/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/9860d/it-pro.webp 750w,\n/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/9ec3b/it-pro.webp 1080w,\n/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/20dcd/it-pro.webp 1366w,\n/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/cc1f6/it-pro.webp 1540w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5194805194805194}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/49cbc7ef20d9383088e20f773af6a13e/it-pro.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/intel-layer5-announce-meshmark-to-quantify-cloud-native-performance"}},{"id":"7c0aa37d-dd05-5ca4-a88f-b3701907e81d","body":"\nimport Formula from \"./MeshMark-Formula.webp\";\nimport MeshmapMeshmark from \"./meshmark-score.webp\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n<p>\nVALENCIA, Spain (May 17th, 2022) - ServiceMeshCon EU /KubeCon EU - <a href=\"https://smp-spec.io/meshmark\">MeshMark</a> is a performance index that measures the <i>value</i> and <i>overhead</i> of your cloud native environment.

As such, it now makes more sense to enable contributors working on both Istio and Kubernetes to work more closely with one another, he adds.\n\nThe decision to apply to become an incubation project comes on the heels of the donation of Knative, an open source middleware for connecting Kubernetes clusters to serverless computing frameworks—also originally created by Google—to the CNCF. Assuming the CNCF accepts the Istio contribution, the three major cloud-native initiatives led by Google would all be governed under the auspices of a CNCF consortium that requires organizations to give up control over the trademarks attached to any open source project.\n\nRyan says IT organizations should expect to see ongoing innovation in the months ahead as competition between various service mesh platforms intensifies. At the same time, there may be opportunities to share advances across multiple service meshes being governed by the CNCF. Those service meshes currently include Linkerd, originally developed by Buoyant, and Kuma, originally developed by Kong, Inc. The CNCF is also home to a Meshery framework for managing service meshes created by Layer5 and a Service Mesh Interface (SMI) project originally created by Microsoft.\n\nService meshes initially emerged as a way to manage APIs at scale instead of relying on proxy software or an API gateway alone. More recently, IT organizations have started to appreciate the programmable layer of abstraction that a service mesh creates above lower-level networking and security interfaces. That layer of abstraction makes those underlying services more accessible to developers.\n\nCompetition between service mesh platforms revolves around two core issues. Service meshes like Linkerd are considerably lighter-weight than, for example, Istio. That makes them simpler for a developer to implement. Istio’s advocates argue that it’s only a matter of time before enterprise IT organizations will need the richer set of capabilities their preferred service mesh enables. Of course, the more robust the feature set of a service mesh, the more likely it is to require an IT operations team that has been trained to implement and manage it. The other issue is to what degree a service mesh might need to be applied to both cloud-native and legacy application environments. Unlike Istio or Linkerd, the Kuma service mesh runs across both Kubernetes clusters and virtual machines.\n\nRegardless of the service Mesh platform selected, it is clear that programmatically managing network services is now much closer to becoming a mainstream part of any DevOps workflow.\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Google Petitions to Donate Istio Service Mesh to CNCF","date":"April 25th, 2022","author":"Container Journal","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://containerjournal.com/features/google-petitions-to-donate-istio-service-mesh-to-cncf/","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoYAAABXRUJQVlA4IHoAAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCdMoADJ0cjRCDWSAAA/XewSBvyoQYiD1cQHeEFbM7LAg9ddJNbknH9S1TXD3EHxkiIyUhEAJbtt0H21+0x9pCzwwsne34jJMNGmYskXUV0T84CNVNij8wdtgX+LgAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/29d51/istio-to-cncf.webp","srcSet":"/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/e30f5/istio-to-cncf.webp 750w,\n/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/29d51/istio-to-cncf.webp 770w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42857142857142855}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/istio-to-cncf.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRoYAAABXRUJQVlA4IHoAAADQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJYgCdMoADJ0cjRCDWSAAA/XewSBvyoQYiD1cQHeEFbM7LAg9ddJNbknH9S1TXD3EHxkiIyUhEAJbtt0H21+0x9pCzwwsne34jJMNGmYskXUV0T84CNVNij8wdtgX+LgAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/29d51/istio-to-cncf.webp","srcSet":"/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/e30f5/istio-to-cncf.webp 750w,\n/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/29d51/istio-to-cncf.webp 770w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42857142857142855}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/c1852a7b1760d443b508f2e9a4bb6a30/istio-to-cncf.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/google-petitions-to-donate-istio-service-mesh-to-cncf"}},{"id":"9b0a1004-cf4e-5a13-8bd0-a8bda49ae654","body":"\n\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\nAs a forthcoming, ubiquitous layer of cloud native infrastructure, service meshes offer deep and uniform control and visibility into the topology and state of ephemeral microservices.

It’s specifically difficult to consistently apply standard features such as traffic management, security and observability mechanisms across all microservices. This issue grows as the number of microservices climbs into the hundreds and thousands.\n\nThis is where service mesh comes in. Service mesh helps to apply common observability and security features across applications. It’s typically split into a control plane, used to configure features, and a data plane, consisting of a sidecar proxy alongside each application. Nowadays, several service mesh options exist in the market, each with varying levels of complexity.\n\nThe Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is home to much of today’s innovative cloud-native technology. The foundation now hosts a few service meshes and related projects. Below, we’ll outline the CNCF service mesh toolset to better understand how engineers can adopt these tools and their benefits.\n\n</NewsWrapper>","frontmatter":{"title":"6 CNCF Service Mesh Tools","date":"October 15th, 2021","author":"Container Journal","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://containerjournal.com/features/6-cncf-service-mesh-tools","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAACQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFapEwoJSOiMAgBABoJYgC7ABuk0bOyyqZgAP7p6OmnnCJO5bEuRFOOaGK/LzEkAUhqxyi9UCgm/v4AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9a8ad42f3ee07fb4c143a6a162b9484c/29d51/mesh-tools.webp","srcSet":"/static/9a8ad42f3ee07fb4c143a6a162b9484c/e30f5/mesh-tools.webp 750w,\n/static/9a8ad42f3ee07fb4c143a6a162b9484c/29d51/mesh-tools.webp 770w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42857142857142855}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/9a8ad42f3ee07fb4c143a6a162b9484c/mesh-tools.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRlQAAABXRUJQVlA4IEgAAACQAwCdASoUAAkAPtFapEwoJSOiMAgBABoJYgC7ABuk0bOyyqZgAP7p6OmnnCJO5bEuRFOOaGK/LzEkAUhqxyi9UCgm/v4AAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/9a8ad42f3ee07fb4c143a6a162b9484c/29d51/mesh-tools.webp","srcSet":"/static/9a8ad42f3ee07fb4c143a6a162b9484c/e30f5/mesh-tools.webp 750w,\n/static/9a8ad42f3ee07fb4c143a6a162b9484c/29d51/mesh-tools.webp 770w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.42857142857142855}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/9a8ad42f3ee07fb4c143a6a162b9484c/mesh-tools.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/6-cncf-service-mesh-tools"}},{"id":"1ffdfb7b-b0bf-52fe-a1e9-68e00a4f0f56","body":"\n\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\nThe Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) announced this week during the ServiceMeshCon/KubeCon + CloudNativeCon conference that Meshery, a service mesh management plane created by Layer5, has become a sandbox-level project.\n\nIn addition, Layer5 has also donated Service Mesh Performance (SMP), a set of tools for measuring the efficiency of a service mesh, to the CNCF.

With the myriad service meshes available and their sophisticated configurations, distributed systems efficacy and performance management is a continuous concern.\n\n“We donated the Service Mesh Performance specification and body of research surrounding it offers a much-needed vendor-neutral home for providing (often contentious) insights to the popular performance and efficiency questions facing service mesh vendors and more broadly cloud native infrastructure”, said Layer5 Founder and CEO Lee Calcote. “Service Mesh Performance provides a unified framework to define standardized benchmarking practices, performance test configurations, homogenous measurements, and ultimately, MeshMark, a new performance measurement index to measure the efficiency of  service meshes and their workloads both in and outside of Kubernetes.”\n\n<h3>Standardizing Service Mesh Value Measurement</h3>\n\n<a href=\"https://smp-spec.io\">Service Mesh Performance</a> is a vendor neutral, cloud native performance measurement standard for capturing and characterizing application and infrastructure efficiency, including details of infrastructure capacity, service mesh configuration, and workload metadata.\n<ol>\n    <li>the ability to reason over the efficiency by which cloud native infrastructure is run, specifically in context of a service mesh and its network functions, including custom filters and/or protocol translators using WebAssembly or other.</li>\n    <li>standard benchmarks of service mesh performance</li>\n    <li>common vernacular and measurement for exchange of performance information from system-to-system and mesh-to-mesh</li>\n    <li>apples-to-apples performance comparisons of service mesh deployments and tooling to trend workload performance.</li>\n    <li>a universal performance index to gauge a service mesh’s efficiency against deployments in other organizations’ environments.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>\"A common language and understanding when dealing with system performance measurements is incredibly important when comparing benchmarks from different systems or historical data from a single system; a slight variation in the measurement approach completely invalidates the comparison.”, said Nic Jackson, SMP Maintainer and Principal Developer Advocate at HashiCorp. “SMP attempts to solve these problems, bringing together a community of incredibly knowledgeable practitioners passionate about improving system performance measurements.\"</p>\n\n<img src={smpMeshery} alt=\"SMP in Meshery\"/>\n\n<h3>CNCF Adopts the Service Mesh Performance project</h3>\n\nWith multiple academic institutions and many vendors involved in the project, the CNCF provides a neutral place for publication of this research and encourages participation from each service mesh vendor under the promise of unbiased analysis, which will help all involved to collectively improve their service mesh implementations and end users to improve operations of their deployments.\n\n“As communication networks evolve toward cloud native 5G and Edge computing, service mesh forms the basis of underlying infrastructure and application networking”, said Sunku Raganath, SMP Maintainer and Solutions Architect at Intel. “Studying service mesh performance across the multitude of deployment scenarios enables us to understand its impact on latency and throughput, in turn, enabling application developers and infrastructure providers to customize and control service mesh behavior within these latency constrained environments”. Service Mesh Performance is squarely focused on critical scenarios of performance management across 5G and Edge computing environments. “An efficient service mesh performance for the given combination of resources for a particular KPI will determine whether the current hardware and software scheduling environment is optimal or needs a change“, said Mrittika Ganguli, Director and PE, cloud native solutions, NEXG, Intel.\n\n\n<h3>Partnership with University of Texas at Austin, Intel, HashiCorp, and Red Hat engineers</h3>\n\n“More than performance, in collaboration with our maintainers from Layer5, Intel, Red Hat, and HashiCorp, we are actively standardizing service mesh value measurement in the form of a new index to be announced early next year”, said Calcote. “As a foundation for this research, 5,000 service mesh performance tests donated by users of Meshery have been donated and are under analysis.” \n\nPerformance tests are run by Meshery, the open source, multi-mesh manager. Meshery is the canonical implementation of Service Mesh Performance (SMP) and the conformance tool of Service Mesh Interface (SMI). Meshery implements and helps users adopt and vendors uphold these specifications. A jointly authored paper on service mesh performance methodologies will be published by the IEEE later this month, which explores how to model your service mesh topology and optimize for your ideal configuration in context of how much operators value properties of resiliency, performance, throughput, and latency.\n\n<h3>Service Mesh Performance Resources</h3>\n<ul>\n    <li><a href=\"https://smp-spec.io/subscribe\">Community Newsletter</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://discuss.layer5.io\">Service Mesh Discussion Forum</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/smp_spec\">Service Mesh Performance Twitter</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/service-mesh-performance\">Service Mesh Performance LinkedIn</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yrncjtPpg4&list=PL3A-A6hPO2INwi8A3NNClvdCxDoHa9NOU\">Service Mesh Performance YouTube</a></li>\n    <li><a href=\"https://smp-spec.io\">Service Mesh Performance Website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>About Layer5</h3>\nLayer5 offers cloud native application management by harnessing the unique position service meshes have in changing how developers write applications, how operators run modern infrastructure and how product owners manage their service offerings.

For the time being, he said, both SMI and SMP are “relatively younger projects, both of which still are figuring out what they want to be when they grow up,” and may be considered for consolidation later on down the line, while Meshery has a larger focus than the two projects and will definitely be kept on its own.\n\nWhile the SMI works to define the broadest characteristics that could apply to something defined as a service mesh, looking for the lowest common denominator, Meshery works in the opposite direction, trying to accentuate the differences and strengths of the individual services meshes. SMP, meanwhile, is more of a specification and works to provide a common format for capturing and describing data around the performance of the service mesh itself.\n\nIn comparison to SMI, Calcote said that “SMP essentially just goes a lot deeper. Part of what is trying to address is this long-standing question — and it’s a question that faces the people who are adopting a service mesh today, people who are adopting service mesh tomorrow, people who have already adopted a service mesh — What should I be measuring to consider how efficiently I’m running my service mesh?”\n\nBetween the three projects, then, users have not just a way to interface with any SMI-compatible service mesh via a common API, but also a way to measure the performance of different service meshes, and finally, a method with which to interface with and operate those service meshes while taking advantage of their specific advantages.\n\n“Part of the belief is that service meshes are an inevitable new layer in your cloud native infrastructure that over time will be a ubiquitous component,” said Calcote. “There’s a lot that can be done in the network, a lot of intelligence, and so Meshery, as a management plane, picks off some of those features.”\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"CNCF Projects Bring Service Mesh Interoperability, Benchmarks","date":"July 24th, 2021","author":"The New Stack","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://thenewstack.io/cncf-projects-bring-service-mesh-interoperability-benchmarks/","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/1b1b219f5ff2ed23523b02bd172f4c07/The-New-Stack-Logo.svg"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/1b1b219f5ff2ed23523b02bd172f4c07/The-New-Stack-Logo.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/cncf-projects-bring-service-mesh-interoperability-benchmarks"}},{"id":"d5db9e8a-0505-5a0f-8718-60931d1ea9f9","body":"\n\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\n<div>\nDevOps teams use the right tools to automate deployment plans to minimize risk to the product and customer experience.

It is developed by Solo.io, a service connectivity company. This service was launched in late-2019. The service allows its users to automate the service mesh interface for chaos experimentation, adaptive security, canary automation, and more.\n\n**Consul:** Consul, a service mesh solution, has a full-featured control plane. It was first released in 2014 and developed by HashiCorp. This service mesh can be installed and configured on an existing Kubernetes cluster. Its latest version is 1.9.5 that was released on April 15, 2021\n\n**OSM:** Open Service Mesh (OSM) is an open-source service mesh created by Microsoft that supports the Kubernetes environment. It is a cloud-native service mesh that allows users to manage and secure service meshes consistently. It also offers out-of-the-box observability features for dynamic microservice environments.\n\n**Layer5:** Layer5 is a service mesh company and a worldwide community that offers a large collection of service mesh projects. The community creates and maintains several projects that focus on the service mesh-centric capabilities in a cloud-based environment.\nThe key projects operating under the Layer5 community include: `Meshery`, `Learn Layer5`, `Service Mesh Landscape`, `Image Hub`, `Meshery Operator`, `Service Mesh Interface Conformance`, and `NightHawk`.\n\n**Kuma:** Kuma is an open-source service mesh that provides support for multiple environments across clouds, such as Kubernetes and virtual machines. It was created by Kong, and it was recently added to CNCF as a Sandbox project. Moreover, Kuma is production-ready, and it is still under active development.\n\n</div>\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"5 Lesser-Known, But Extremely Powerful Kubernetes Service Mesh Tools","date":"June 18th, 2021","author":"TechGenix","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://techgenix.com/kubernetes-service-mesh-tools/","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpgAAABXRUJQVlA4IIwAAABQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZgCdAB9pIQtJHMb0adr3YHYAAP7tJ1NrnPpDtvGpt7brKer8G134gCRlvCJ7Hiq5yiKFcbg2BqHU0Clqc10JmY4yTR+84sxdcD1YOdAgx4a3nDtOLfW2qE7XFh1g8iqu+AQbOhJYa/oa2/r8yr14MRMAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/c512e/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp","srcSet":"/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/a66aa/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 750w,\n/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/65dd5/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 1080w,\n/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/4fad6/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 1366w,\n/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/c512e/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpgAAABXRUJQVlA4IIwAAABQBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZgCdAB9pIQtJHMb0adr3YHYAAP7tJ1NrnPpDtvGpt7brKer8G134gCRlvCJ7Hiq5yiKFcbg2BqHU0Clqc10JmY4yTR+84sxdcD1YOdAgx4a3nDtOLfW2qE7XFh1g8iqu+AQbOhJYa/oa2/r8yr14MRMAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/c512e/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp","srcSet":"/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/a66aa/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 750w,\n/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/65dd5/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 1080w,\n/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/4fad6/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 1366w,\n/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/c512e/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp 1920w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5625}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/43427f194c9f6f161811d46d58e960ba/kubernetes-with-mesh-tools.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/5-lesser-known-but-extremely-powerful-kubernetes-service-mesh-tools"}},{"id":"459562ad-b96a-5c5e-b19c-6870f3a21187","body":"\n\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\n<div>\n\n\"Cloud native\" doesn't just mean \"running in the cloud.\" It's a specific deployment paradigm and uses containers and an orchestration system (usually Kubernetes) to help provision, schedule, run and control a production workload in the cloud, or even across multiple clouds. Within cloud native deployments, an increasingly common approach to networking is the service mesh concept. With a service mesh, instead of each individual container requiring a full networking stack, a grouping of containers all benefit from a mesh that provides connectivity and networking with other containers as well as the outside world.\n\nService mesh in the wild\nWhile the concept of a service mesh has applicability beyond just Kubernetes deployments, that's arguably where the vast majority of deployments are today. Among the earliest cloud-native service mesh approaches is the open source Linkerd project, which is backed by Buoyant and began to really ramp up adoption in 2017.\n\nOver the past three years there has been an explosion of open source service mesh technology. Layer5, which develops service mesh aggregation technology, currently tracks over 20 different open and closed source mesh projects. Beyond Linkerd, among the most popular is the Google-backed Istio project, which recently hit its 1.8 milestone release. Cisco has backed the Network Service Mesh (NSM) effort, which works at a lower level in the networking stack than Linkerd, Istio and most others.\n\nEach mesh has its own take on configuration and capabilities, which is a good thing for users. Simply put, there is no shortage of options and there is likely to be a service mesh that already exists to meet just about any need.\n\nService mesh abstraction\nWhile having lots of different service mesh technologies is good for choice, it's not necessarily a good thing for simplicity or interoperability. That's where the concept of service mesh abstraction comes into play.\n\nAt the recent KubeCon NA 2020 virtual event, Lee Calcote, co-chair of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Networking Special Interest Group (SIG) and founder of Layer5, outlined how the different service mesh abstraction technologies fit together.\n\nThe Service Mesh Interface (SMI) is a way for any compliant service mesh to plug into Kubernetes. The Service Mesh Performance (SMP) abstraction is all about providing visibility into service mesh performance though a common interface. The third key abstraction is known as Hamlet and it provides multi-vendor service interoperation and mesh federation capabilities.\n\nService mesh benefits\nThere are a number of different benefits that service meshes can bring, which are helping to accelerate adoption. Calcote explained that with a service mesh there is a decoupling of developer and operations teams such that each can iterate independently.\n\nAs such, operators can make changes to infrastructure independent of developers. DevOps is supposed to mean developer and operations teams work together, but the reality is often quite different and the ability to build application and infrastructure separately is why service mesh has been such a winning proposition for so many organizations.\n\n\"We live within a software defined network landscape, and service meshes in some respects are sort of a next-gen SDN,\" Calcote said.\n\n</div>\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Service Mesh Offers Promising Solution for Cloud Native Networking","date":"December 4th, 2020","author":"Enterprise Networking Planet","category":"Coverage","eurl":"http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/datacenter/datacenter-blog/service-mesh-cloud-native-networking.html","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpIAAABXRUJQVlA4IIYAAAAwBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZQC7IDZgmudmGpiGoFX6QKQA/vJjCvgvJkbUF3Y/liMf2Cr8/xo37hrE91bGryC9YOKTJG8D8g1+ChfX6+G1GWpa9O7A7elEBZNUcKzVonLWpxYHA/+hwJ2RWKO+4cLpZL/I4FlFrcEH454AAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a2808ac8b497f7848fa6155fba8bb718/6d672/service-mesh.webp","srcSet":"/static/a2808ac8b497f7848fa6155fba8bb718/6d672/service-mesh.webp 600w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5266666666666667}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a2808ac8b497f7848fa6155fba8bb718/service-mesh.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRpIAAABXRUJQVlA4IIYAAAAwBACdASoUAAsAPtFUo0uoJKMhsAgBABoJZQC7IDZgmudmGpiGoFX6QKQA/vJjCvgvJkbUF3Y/liMf2Cr8/xo37hrE91bGryC9YOKTJG8D8g1+ChfX6+G1GWpa9O7A7elEBZNUcKzVonLWpxYHA/+hwJ2RWKO+4cLpZL/I4FlFrcEH454AAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/a2808ac8b497f7848fa6155fba8bb718/6d672/service-mesh.webp","srcSet":"/static/a2808ac8b497f7848fa6155fba8bb718/6d672/service-mesh.webp 600w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.5266666666666667}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/a2808ac8b497f7848fa6155fba8bb718/service-mesh.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/service-mesh-offers-promising-solution-for-cloud-native-networking"}},{"id":"fd6ca157-b8fb-5194-9d9f-4ebdc2afca86","body":"\n\nimport serviceMeshAbstractions from \"./service-mesh-abstractions.webp\";\nimport serviceMeshPerformance from \"./service-mesh-performance.webp\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\nAs more organizations implement service meshes, they are finding what works and what needs more work, and they are creating new management practices around this knowledge. A few tried-and-tested best practices were detailed last month during KubeCon+CloudNativeCon.\n\n“There’s a lot to say about each of these service meshes and how they work: their architecture, why they’re made, what they’re focused on, what they do when they came about and why some of them aren’t here anymore and why we’re still seeing new ones,” Lee Calcote, founder of Layer5, explained during his talk entitled “Service Mesh Specifications and Why They Matter in Your Deployment.”\n\nService mesh is increasingly seen as a requirement to manage microservices in Kubernetes environments, offering a central control plane to manage microservices access, testing, metrics and other functionalities. One-third of the respondents in The New Stack survey of our readers said their organizations already use service mesh. Among the numerous service mesh options available; Envoy, Istio, Linkerd and Kuma are but a few on offer.\n\n### Interoperability Is Key as Service Meshes Come and Go\n\nOrganizations will likely look to use at least more than one API service layer and service mesh for their clusters. This is why interoperability, and thus specifications, are critical for control planes as well. During his talk — “Service Mesh Specifications and Why They Matter in Your Deployment” mentioned above — for example, Calcote, asked rhetorically:\n\n“How many specifications, how many standards are there that have come to the rescue, so to speak, for understanding and interoperating with the various service meshes that are out there?” Calcote said.\n\n<a href={serviceMeshAbstractions}><img src={serviceMeshAbstractions} alt=\"service-mesh-abstractions\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n\nA service mesh can be used for testing router performance, service latency and other variables. However, determining service mesh performance in an apples-to-apples way can be challenging. When studying “published results from some of the service meshes [from providers] that do publish results about performance… what you’ll find is that they’re probably using an environment that isn’t necessarily like yours,” Calcote said. “They’re also using different statistics and metrics to measure [their service meshes] … and it doesn’t help.”\n\n<a href={serviceMeshPerformance}><img src={serviceMeshPerformance} alt=\"service-mesh-performance\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n\nService mesh performance (SMP) was created in an attempt to establish a way of comparing the performance of different services. “The SMP was born in combination with engaging with a few of those different service mesh maintainers and creating a standard way of articulating a performance of a mesh,” Calcote said.\n\nAmong the variables in consideration, in addition to the service mesh itself, include the number of clusters, workloads, the types of nodes, control plan configuration and the use of client libraries all affect performance.\n\n“What costs more, what’s more efficient and what’s more powerful: These are all open questions that SMP assists in answering in your environment,” Calcote said.\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"KubeCon+CloudNativeCon","date":"December 2nd, 2020","author":"The New Stack","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://thenewstack.io/kubeconcloudnativecon-service-mesh-battle-stories-and-fixes/","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAgAPtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJYgCdMoADf76Io9ukEMKaAAD+0NVX8yrCCYso0t4m+uqXvUNcjspWp5cPsm9igQenys+i4un1qy0qCumd6/zcds2HFNCb9SqZQTZuLg8wT+AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/09f13/service-mesh-implementations.webp","srcSet":"/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/b07c1/service-mesh-implementations.webp 750w,\n/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/09f13/service-mesh-implementations.webp 1024w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.41503906250000006}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/service-mesh-implementations.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnYAAABXRUJQVlA4IGoAAAAQBACdASoUAAgAPtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJYgCdMoADf76Io9ukEMKaAAD+0NVX8yrCCYso0t4m+uqXvUNcjspWp5cPsm9igQenys+i4un1qy0qCumd6/zcds2HFNCb9SqZQTZuLg8wT+AA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/09f13/service-mesh-implementations.webp","srcSet":"/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/b07c1/service-mesh-implementations.webp 750w,\n/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/09f13/service-mesh-implementations.webp 1024w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.41503906250000006}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/3bbaf49e171ac3012bc61c5567dd6aed/service-mesh-implementations.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/kubeconcloudnativecon"}},{"id":"f1c49ff8-1bac-5e85-aac8-a2c63d80156e","body":"\nimport kubernetes from \"./kubernetes-platform.webp\";\n\n<img align=\"left\" style={{padding: \"15px\"}} src={kubernetes} alt=\"Kubernetes-platform\" />\n\nA service mesh has become a critical part of platforms based on Kubernetes clusters. It provides both east-west and north-south traffic managementxi, security, observability, and shaping for services implemented by the cluster and supporting components. As clusters have grown in size and platforms have become comprised of many clusters, maintaining a consistent view, management, and policies for network layer 4 – 7 traffic has become increasingly complex.\n\n<p>\nIn response, a number of vendors have extended control planes with a multi-cluster management layer such that they federate and manage service meshes at scale across multiple clouds and on-premises deployments. Both Hashicorp Consul and VMWare Tanzu NSX Service Mesh extend the service mesh control plane past the local service mesh to allow a management layer over multiple clouds and clusters. <u>The open source project <a href=\"/cloud-native-management/meshery\"><b>Meshery</b></a> is also providing a service mesh management plane as separate software that can interact using the Service Mesh Interface or through built-for-purpose adapters for a variety of existing service mesh products and projects.</u>\n</p>\n\nLike Kubernetes control planes, this extension of the service mesh control plane allows for consistent management and policies across clusters in different environments, a situation that is becoming more typical in enterprise IT applications.\n\nService mesh control plane federation is an emerging feature of service mesh products.

Layer5’s [Meshery](https://layer5.io/cloud-native-management/meshery), the cloud native management plane, and HashiCorp’s [Consul](https://consul.io) integrate to provide advanced, cloud native infrastructure solutions for containerized and non-containerized workloads - strengths of Consul. The marriage of these technologies forms a layering of network planes: data, control, and management.\n\n<a href={layer5_hashicorp_partnership}><img src={layer5_hashicorp_partnership} alt=\"layer5-hashicorp-partnership\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n\n_Service Mesh Planes: Consul and Meshery. Learn more about service mesh planes in [The Enterprise Path to Service Mesh Architectures](https://layer5.io/books/the-enterprise-path-to-service-mesh-architectures)._\n\nConsul’s broad and prevalent use across [any runtime or infrastructure](https://learn.hashicorp.com/consul/datacenter-deploy/reference-architecture) (bare metal servers, virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and any cloud) is a key facilitator of the modernization of IT infrastructure - a significant attractant for Layer5 to focus on this integration; to meet customers where they’re at. The lynchpin of the integration of Consul and Meshery is the Meshery Adapter for Consul. Through this adapter, Meshery facilitates lifecycle management of Consul service mesh deployments, evaluates and espouses configuration best practices published by HashiCorp. Meshery provides users with an interface to apply custom configuration to their Consul service mesh in an ad hoc fashion.\n\n### Lifecycle management of sample applications\n\nThe [Meshery Adapter for Consul](https://docs.meshery.io/service-meshes/adapters/consul) comes bundled with a handful of sample applications for evaluating, exploring, and learning how to operate Consul service mesh. Many operators are new to the ongoing administrative tasks of running a healthy and optimized Consul service mesh deployment. In advance of their production deployments, operators may utilize Meshery to quickly deploy Consul with sample applications to gain familiarity with the many features of Consul.\n\nDemonstrated at DockerCon 2020, is the “[Image Hub](https://github.com/layer5io/image-hub)”, a sample application built to allow users to explore Consul’s feature set, and specifically, an experimental area of Consul’s data plane: Envoy’s impending support for WebAssembly.\n\n### Performance management of Consul and it’s workloads\n\nIn order to assess the overall performance of the service mesh, and the overhead of individual, fine-grained traffic control mechanisms defined in Consul’s control plane and enforced through Consul’s intelligent data plane, Meshery provides users with statistical analysis of the responsiveness of their services and performance of the service mesh. As highlighted by Docker Captain, [Luc Juggery](https://twitter.com/lucjuggery), performance is an ongoing concern:\n\n<div style={{margin: \"20px\"}}>\nRunning a performance test is not a one shot thing. Tests should be run on a regular basis to (re)establish baselines and evaluate configuration changes:\n<ul>\n<li>- for each new release of the chosen service mesh</li>\n<li>- for each change of the configuration of your service mesh</li>\n<li>- for each new release of the application\"</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\nMeshery’s ability to connect to Prometheus instances to retrieve and account for cluster and application-level metrics is popularly used during Meshery’s service mesh performance tests. Likewise, Meshery’s ability to connect to and import existing dashboards, panels, and charts from Grafana is instrumental in allowing users to retain their existing investment in dashboards and metrics they have curated over time.\n\n## Meshery Announces Experimental Support for WebAssembly using Consul\n\nToday, at [DockerCon 2020](https://docker.events.cube365.net/docker/dockercon/content/Videos/63TCCNpzDC7Xxnm8b), we demonstrate technology leadership in advanced data plane engineering for near-native performance of fine-grained traffic control facilitated by Meshery and Consul with the use of Envoy and WebAssembly.\n\n<a href={layer5_image_hub}><img src={layer5_image_hub} alt=\"layer5-hashicorp-imagehub\" width=\"100%\" /></a>\n\n_In this demonstration, Meshery takes advantage of Consul’s use of Envoy. Envoy support for WebAssembly is impending._\n\n### WebAssembly’s near-native performance\n\nWebAssembly, or WASM, is an open standard that defines a binary format for executable programs. Through WebAssembly System Interface (WASI), it also defines interfaces for facilitating interaction with host environments. The initial focus of these host environments was browsers and large web applications with the intention of securely running programs to improve performance. As an open standard, WASM is maintained by the W3C, and has been adopted by all modern browsers. After HTML, CSS, and Javascript, WebAssembly is the fourth language to natively run in web browsers.\n\nWebAssembly is exciting because of its performance characteristics, running between 10% to 20% overhead as compared to natively executed code for network filtering use cases. WebAssembly bears some resemblance to Docker given its high degree of portability. Like the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), WASM’s virtual stack machine is becoming a write once, run anywhere (WORA). WASM executables are precompiled with a healthy variety of languages supporting it as a compilation target - currently about 40 languages.\n\nWASM support is coming to Envoy through the efforts of Google, and Envoy maintainers embedding Google's open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, V8, into Envoy. Through the WebAssembly System Interface, Envoy exposes an Application Binary Interface (ABI) to WASM modules, so that they can operate as Envoy filters. The way WASI works is straight-forward. You write your application in your favourite languages like Rust, C or C++. Then, build and compile them into a WebAssembly binary targeting the host environment. The generated binary requires the WebAssembly runtime to provide the necessary interfaces to system calls for the binary to execute. Conceptually, this is similar to JVM. If you have a JVM installed then you can run any Java-like languages on it. Similarly, with a runtime, you can run the WebAssembly binary.\n\n## Learn more\n\nThis integration of management, control, and data planes is a powerful combination.

an organization is forced to manage distributed service-to-service communication over a large network, service mesh provides a dedicated layer where separate parts of an application can communicate with each other. This way, software teams can centralize communication, rather than monitor each individual service message exchange independently.\n\nWhen service mesh emerged in 2018, many saw this technology as a way to tackle the complexity of container deployment at production scale. They also saw it as a way to address unsustainable manual traffic management processes.\n\nIn 2019, the success of service mesh implementation inspired a rush of vendors that hoped to cash in on the need to manage services at scale. The industry saw a booming sub-ecosystem around two major service mesh options, Google's Istio and the open source Envoy, plus many à la carte tools, such as Tetrate and Meshery. A handful of newcomers jumped into the fray, such as HashiCorp, Kong, Containous, Aspen Mesh and Layer5. Despite the competition, Istio and Envoy led the pack.\n\nThe service mesh market saw two significant events in 2019. First, Envoy Project Authors fine-tuned its increasingly popular sidecar proxy design pattern. Second, Google kept its service mesh technology, and Istio, out of the open source Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and thereby retained proprietary control.\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Vendors make a splash in 2019 service mesh implementation rush","date":"December 27th, 2019","author":"TechTarget","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/feature/Vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnQAAABXRUJQVlA4IGgAAABQBACdASoUAAYAPtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJZQCdH8G6A5/8B5Pd7JAOdIsAAP7Hfg7V6Cw+lBvPBuF5PLewMAEGH3x14wTH6pKuiqCh/pETb+DWCdaMnSQXMD8R1kSMqbBP+Ao0ZoAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/c6e26/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp","srcSet":"/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/440b4/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp 750w,\n/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/4dabe/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp 1080w,\n/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/c6e26/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp 1274w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.3021978021978022}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRnQAAABXRUJQVlA4IGgAAABQBACdASoUAAYAPtFWpEuoJKOhsAgBABoJZQCdH8G6A5/8B5Pd7JAOdIsAAP7Hfg7V6Cw+lBvPBuF5PLewMAEGH3x14wTH6pKuiqCh/pETb+DWCdaMnSQXMD8R1kSMqbBP+Ao0ZoAAAA=="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/c6e26/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp","srcSet":"/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/440b4/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp 750w,\n/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/4dabe/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp 1080w,\n/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/c6e26/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp 1274w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.3021978021978022}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/34068b4bb8760d9d00922b48df09397b/2019-12-27-vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/vendors-make-a-splash-in-2019-service-mesh-implementation-rush"}},{"id":"d54999fc-e89f-5c6b-935a-5af585bf53eb","body":"\n\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\nIn 2019, we saw service mesh move beyond an experimental technology and into a solution that organizations are beginning to learn is an elemental building block for any successful Kubernetes deployment. Adoption of service mesh at scale, across companies large and small, began to gain steam. As the second wave of adopters watched the cutting edge adopters trial and succeed with service mesh technology, they too began to evaluate service mesh to address the challenges Kubernetes leaves on the table.\n<br/>\n\nIn tandem with growing adoption of service mesh, 2019 offered a burgeoning service mesh market. Istio and Linkerd keep chugging along, and the tooling and vendor ecosystem around Istio almost tripled throughout the year. But there were also many new players that entered the market providing alternative approaches to solving layer seven networking challenges. Meshes, such as those Kuma and Maesh offer, have emerged to provide different approaches to service mesh in order to address various edge use cases. We also saw the introduction of tools like [Service Mesh Interface](https://smi-spec.io/) spec and [Meshery](https://layer5.io/meshery/) attempt to engage an early market that is flourishing due to immense opportunity, but has yet to contract while key players are waiting for the market to choose the winners first. Adjacent projects like [Network Service Mesh](https://networkservicemesh.io/) bring service mesh principles to lower layers of the stack.\n<br/>\n\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Meshery in top 3 service mesh developments in 2020","date":"December 12th, 2019","author":"The New Stack","category":"Coverage","eurl":"https://thenewstack.io/the-top-3-service-mesh-developments-in-2020/","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRr4AAABXRUJQVlA4ILIAAABQBQCdASoUABIAPtFcok4oJSKiKA1RABoJZAC1Gy/lvQwDPxKvEGRfFu90PUVDp1QXgAAA/ufjO56dRxtwAdARiX21W2xYHKwFys8WfnpU3Q8u912iDFv4Yyhpmy0BSZ1fpQ+ikh9JSGSXilJufNsKum3VfZPJAXJeWKrKdBX1RLkiM9SDJKoyFAzgdj3y76yFQiTlVbANwJsHp45bR+OKeWis0LDrCQe9jcPYAs3WCAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b8151b980f351e8733505acaa801c470/265bf/Meshery_top3_servish_mesh_development.webp","srcSet":"/static/b8151b980f351e8733505acaa801c470/265bf/Meshery_top3_servish_mesh_development.webp 649w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.8921417565485361}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b8151b980f351e8733505acaa801c470/Meshery_top3_servish_mesh_development.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRr4AAABXRUJQVlA4ILIAAABQBQCdASoUABIAPtFcok4oJSKiKA1RABoJZAC1Gy/lvQwDPxKvEGRfFu90PUVDp1QXgAAA/ufjO56dRxtwAdARiX21W2xYHKwFys8WfnpU3Q8u912iDFv4Yyhpmy0BSZ1fpQ+ikh9JSGSXilJufNsKum3VfZPJAXJeWKrKdBX1RLkiM9SDJKoyFAzgdj3y76yFQiTlVbANwJsHp45bR+OKeWis0LDrCQe9jcPYAs3WCAAA"},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/b8151b980f351e8733505acaa801c470/265bf/Meshery_top3_servish_mesh_development.webp","srcSet":"/static/b8151b980f351e8733505acaa801c470/265bf/Meshery_top3_servish_mesh_development.webp 649w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.8921417565485361}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/b8151b980f351e8733505acaa801c470/Meshery_top3_servish_mesh_development.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/meshery-in-top-3-service-mesh-developments-in-2020"}},{"id":"8ada4780-d7c3-53ca-9308-b2a9f9bd7e0d","body":"\n\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\nKubeCon NA 2019 - San Diego, CA\n\nAt KubeCon 2019, Lee Calcote and Matt Klein introducted the CNCF's latest Special Interest Group for cloud native networking.\n\n<iframe width=\"450\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XZ6TZQeNuKQ\" loading=\"lazy\" frameBorder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowFullScreen></iframe>\n\nRelated news by Sean Michael Kerner: <a href=\"http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/datacenter/cncf-sig-network-set-to-push-cloud-native-networking-forward.html\">\nCNCF SIG Network Set to Push Cloud Native Networking Forward </a> (Posted Nov 23, 2019).\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"KubeCon NA: CNCF SIG Network Set Intro and Deep-Dive","date":"November 23rd, 2019","author":"Enterprise Networking Planet","category":"Coverage","eurl":"","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/fcc022de95829bfc4034ed72a6323daa/KubeCon_NA_2019_bg-01.svg"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":null,"extension":"svg","publicURL":"/static/fcc022de95829bfc4034ed72a6323daa/KubeCon_NA_2019_bg-01.svg"}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/kubecon-na-cncf-sig-network-set-intro-and-deep-dive"}},{"id":"af6a2b2f-425f-5264-b425-98974f7a008a","body":"\nimport SIG_network from \"./SIG-network-367x200.webp\";\n\n<NewsWrapper>\n\n<i>By Sean Michael Kerner | <a href=\"http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/datacenter/cncf-sig-network-set-to-push-cloud-native-networking-forward.html\">Enterprise Networking Planet</a> | Posted Nov 23, 2019</i>\n\n\nSAN DIEGO. The inaugural public meeting the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Networking Special Interest Group (SIG) was held in a session at the KubeCon event on Nov. 19, ushering in a new era for networking at the highly influential open source group.\n\n<img src={SIG_network} style={{position: \"relative\", float: \"right\"}} alt=\"SIG-network\" />\n\nThe CNCF is home to many different projects, including the Kubernetes container orchestration system. Kubernetes itself has its' own set of SIGs, which is the core organizing unit for the project, among those SIGs is one for networking. The CNCF however is a bigger organization that just Kubernetes and includes over 40 projects. CNCF SIGs cut across all projects, with cross project concerns in different topic areas.\n\nLee Calcote, Founder at Layer5 and one of the leaders of CNCF TAG Network explained during the session that there are already a few network specific projects within the CNCF, including CNI (Container Network Interface), CoreDNS, Envoy, gRPC, Linkerd, NATS and the Network Service Mesh project.\n\n\"Part of what we're hoping to do is with SIGs in general is to help more impact fully scale the CNCF Technical Oversight Committee (TOC),\" Calcote said.\n\nRead more on <a href=\"http://www.enterprisenetworkingplanet.com/datacenter/cncf-sig-network-set-to-push-cloud-native-networking-forward.html\">Enterprise Networking Planet</a>...\n\n</NewsWrapper>\n","frontmatter":{"title":"CNCF SIG Network Set to Push Cloud Native Networking Forward","date":"November 23rd, 2019","author":"Enterprise Networking Planet","category":"Coverage","eurl":"","thumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRq4AAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAABgAAQUxQSBMAAAABD9D/iAgICQia/6ddiOh/SpwEAFZQOCB0AAAA8AMAnQEqFAAHAD7RVqNLqCSjIbAIAQAaCUATpAS8FEL+nDaXC8nbDAD+1PUvXMXn++I9oEqEtpsRi0rHvW+J0v72e0e57Jvr+gObap08+6WfR3cnVtfsLs7ZdBAvVvzWCpfNr/rOe8TlOe6EDLVo1pKYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e2530d60aaedd1607e42c5829acb6273/d791e/enterprise_networking_planet_logo_700px-e1533637827914.webp","srcSet":"/static/e2530d60aaedd1607e42c5829acb6273/d791e/enterprise_networking_planet_logo_700px-e1533637827914.webp 650w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.3692307692307692}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/e2530d60aaedd1607e42c5829acb6273/enterprise_networking_planet_logo_700px-e1533637827914.webp"},"darkthumbnail":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","placeholder":{"fallback":"data:image/webp;base64,UklGRq4AAABXRUJQVlA4WAoAAAAQAAAAEwAABgAAQUxQSBMAAAABD9D/iAgICQia/6ddiOh/SpwEAFZQOCB0AAAA8AMAnQEqFAAHAD7RVqNLqCSjIbAIAQAaCUATpAS8FEL+nDaXC8nbDAD+1PUvXMXn++I9oEqEtpsRi0rHvW+J0v72e0e57Jvr+gObap08+6WfR3cnVtfsLs7ZdBAvVvzWCpfNr/rOe8TlOe6EDLVo1pKYAAA="},"images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e2530d60aaedd1607e42c5829acb6273/d791e/enterprise_networking_planet_logo_700px-e1533637827914.webp","srcSet":"/static/e2530d60aaedd1607e42c5829acb6273/d791e/enterprise_networking_planet_logo_700px-e1533637827914.webp 650w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[]},"width":1,"height":0.3692307692307692}},"extension":"webp","publicURL":"/static/e2530d60aaedd1607e42c5829acb6273/enterprise_networking_planet_logo_700px-e1533637827914.webp"}},"fields":{"slug":"/company/news/cncf-sig-network-set-to-push-cloud-native-networking-forward"}},{"id":"e8085d8d-58ab-507d-a926-c5d8945b62a0","body":"\n\n\n<NewsWrapper>\nToday, Layer5 joins the CNCF.\n\nFrom inception Layer5 has been actively stewarding, maintaining, and contributing to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) initiatives and projects.
