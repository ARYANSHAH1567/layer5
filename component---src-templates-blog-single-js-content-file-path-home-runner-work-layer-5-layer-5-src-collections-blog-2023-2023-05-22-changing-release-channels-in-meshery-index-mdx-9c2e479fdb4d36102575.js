Depending upon your risk aversion and the nature of your deployment environment, having a subscription means that you will automatically receive these updates that you might not be ready incorporate. On the other hand, release channels also offer the ability to pin to a specific release which is a  good thing as it allows users to maintain stability and predictability of their environment by preventing unexpected changes from being introduced into their system.
