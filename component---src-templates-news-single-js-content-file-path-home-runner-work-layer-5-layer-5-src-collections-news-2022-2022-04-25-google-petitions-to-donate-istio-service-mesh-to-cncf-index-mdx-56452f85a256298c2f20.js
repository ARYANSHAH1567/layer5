At the same time, there may be opportunities to share advances across multiple service meshes being governed by the CNCF.

Service meshes like Linkerd are considerably lighter-weight than, for example, Istio. That makes them simpler for a developer to implement. Istio’s advocates argue that it’s only a matter of time before enterprise IT organizations will need the richer set of capabilities their preferred service mesh enables. Of course, the more robust the feature set of a service mesh, the more likely it is to require an IT operations team that has been trained to implement and manage it. The other issue is to what degree a service mesh might need to be applied to both cloud-native and legacy application environments. Unlike Istio or Linkerd, the Kuma service mesh runs across both Kubernetes clusters and virtual machines."),r.createElement(t.p,null,"Regardless of the service Mesh platform selected, it is clear that programmatically managing network services is now much closer to becoming a mainstream part of any DevOps workflow."))}var i=function(e){void 0===e&&(e={});var t=Object.assign({},(0,a.ah)(),e.components).wrapper;return t?r.createElement(t,e,r.createElement(n,e)):n(e)};var s=o(17875),l=o(11155),c=function(e){var t=e.data,o=e.children;return r.createElement(r.Fragment,null,r.createElement(l.Z,{data:t},o))};function m(e){return r.createElement(c,e,r.createElement(i,e))}var h=function(e){var t=e.data;return r.createElement(s.Z,{title:t.mdx.frontmatter.title,image:t.mdx.frontmatter.thumbnail.publicURL})}}}]);
