It's all different code, different languages and  a different service mesh architecture. There's a number of different architectures by which service meshes are deployed.

Maybe there's a load balancer in between.  This structure makes it simple to boost your resiliency."))),n.createElement(t.p,null,"Henrik goes on to elaborate that in service mesh we can do a lot of things to make sure that the communication is reliable.\nWhen you design microservice architecture, there is a need of implementing retry logic. So if a service A needs to introduce another service B, then the service mesh will manage the retry logic such that if we reach at one time and the service B is not responding then the service mesh will try to reach out several times. Therefore a service mesh offers a variety of features like this to manage the certificates within the cluster and and circle them in a regular pace. You can also have traffic splitting if you do canary releases. In your service to service communication, there are a plethora of scenarios that the service mesh can handle.\nHenrik recalled that it's normally difficult to obtain a full view of what rules we've applied in the cluster, and when he first saw Meshery, his immediate thought was, \"Wow, this is exactly what is missing in the market at the moment.\""),n.createElement(t.p,null,"Lets dig deeper into this tool we've been alluding to for a while now: ",n.createElement(i,{to:"/cloud-native-management/meshery"},"Meshery"),"."),n.createElement(t.p,null,n.createElement("h3",null,"Meshery"),"\nIf you were on a pager and were managing a large service mesh deployment with a number of rules and configurations around how security is enforced and identities are managed, and things like uniform observability and how metrics and logs are collected and enforced, and then the different traffic writing rules and stuff.
