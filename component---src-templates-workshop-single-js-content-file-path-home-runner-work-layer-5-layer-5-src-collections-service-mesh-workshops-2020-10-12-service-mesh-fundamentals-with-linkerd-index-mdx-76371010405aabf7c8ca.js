Service meshes have quickly entered the cloud native landscape filling unmet service-level needs. Organizations that have adopted containers and who are running a handful or more of microservices find tools to provide observability, control and security lacking. Operating at layer 5, service meshes promise much value. This live training walks you through a series of hands-on labs, introducing you to each and every aspect of the popular service mesh - Linkerd. During this workshop you will gain hands-on experience as we walk through deploying Linkerd alongside microservices running in Kubernetes."))}var l=function(e){void 0===e&&(e={});var n=Object.assign({},(0,r.ah)(),e.components).wrapper;return n?i.createElement(n,e,i.createElement(a,e)):a(e)},o=t(17875),c=t(33834),s=function(e){var n=e.data,t=e.children;return i.createElement(i.Fragment,null,i.createElement(c.Z,{frontmatter:n.mdx.frontmatter},t))};function u(e){return i.createElement(s,e,i.createElement(l,e))}var m=function(e){var n=e.data;return i.createElement(o.Z,{title:n.mdx.frontmatter.title,image:n.mdx.frontmatter.thumbnail.publicURL})}}}]);
